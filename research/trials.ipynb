Even though its \\nlanguage and ideas have inﬁltrated \\neveryday culture, most people have \\nonly a hazy idea of what the subject \\nis about, and what psychologists \\nactually do. For some, psychology \\nconjures up images of people in \\nwhite coats, either stafﬁng an \\ninstitution for mental disorders or \\nconducting laboratory experiments \\non rats. Others may imagine a man \\nwith a middle-European accent \\npsychoanalyzing a patient on a \\ncouch or, if ﬁlm scripts are to be \\nbelieved, plotting to exercise some \\nform of mind control.\\nAlthough these stereotypes  \\nare an exaggeration, some truth  \\nlies beneath them. It is perhaps  \\nthe huge range of subjects that fall \\nunder the umbrella of psychology \\n(and the bewildering array of terms \\nbeginning with the preﬁx “psych-”) \\nthat creates confusion over what \\npsychology entails; psychologists \\nthemselves are unlikely to agree  \\non a single deﬁnition of the word. \\n“Psychology” comes from the \\nancient Greek psyche, meaning \\n“soul” or “mind,” and logia, a \\n“study” or “account,” which seems \\nto sum up the broad scope of the \\nsubject, but today the word most \\naccurately describes “the science  \\nof mind and behavior.” \\nThe new science\\nPsychology can also be seen as a \\nbridge between philosophy and \\nphysiology. Where physiology \\ndescribes and explains the physical \\nmake-up of the brain and nervous \\nsystem, psychology examines the \\nmental processes that take place \\nwithin them and how these are \\nmanifested in our thoughts, speech, \\nand behavior. Where philosophy is \\nconcerned with thoughts and ideas, \\npsychology studies how we come  \\nto have them and what they tell us \\nabout the workings of our minds. \\nAll the sciences evolved from \\nphilosophy, by applying scientiﬁc \\nmethods to philosophical questions, \\nbut the intangible nature of \\nsubjects such as consciousness, \\nperception, and memory meant that \\npsychology was slow in making  \\nthe transition from philosophical \\nspeculation to scientiﬁc practice.  \\nIn some universities, particularly in \\nthe US, psychology departments \\nstarted out as branches of the \\nphilosophy department, while in \\nothers, notably those in Germany, \\nthey were established in the science \\nfaculties. But it was not until the \\nlate 19th century that psychology \\nbecame established as a scientiﬁc \\ndiscipline in its own right. \\nThe founding of the world’s  \\nﬁrst laboratory of experimental \\npsychology by Wilhelm Wundt  \\nat the University of Leipzig in  \\n1879 marked the recognition of \\npsychology as a truly scientiﬁc \\nsubject, and as one that was \\nbreaking new ground in previously \\nunexplored areas of research.  \\nIn the course of the 20th century, \\npsychology blossomed; all of its  \\nmajor branches and movements \\nevolved.

However, since \\ntemperamental problems are caused \\nby imbalances of the humors, he \\nclaimed they can be cured by diet \\nand exercise. In more extreme \\ncases, cures may include purging \\nand blood-letting. For example, a \\nperson acting selﬁshly is overly \\nsanguine, and has too much blood; \\nthis is remedied by cutting down \\non meat, or by making small cuts \\ninto the veins to release blood. \\nGalen’s doctrines dominated \\nmedicine until the Renaissance, \\nwhen they began to decline in the \\nlight of better research.

This ensured that \\neach participant experienced \\nexactly the same stimulus, enabling \\nresponses of different participants  \\nto be compared and the experiment \\nto be repeated at a later date, if \\nrequired. In insisting upon this \\npossibility for replication, Wundt  \\nset the standard for all future \\npsychological experiments. \\nIn his sensory experiments, \\nWundt set out to explore human \\nconsciousness in a measurable  \\nway. He refused to see it as an \\nunknowable, subjective experience \\nthat is unique to each individual.  \\nIn the light-response experiments, \\nhe was particularly interested in the \\namount of time between a person \\nreceiving some form of stimulus and \\nmaking a voluntary reaction to it \\n(rather than an involuntary one),  \\nand he used various instruments  \\nto measure this response exactly. \\nHe was also just as interested to \\nhear what his participants reported  \\nin common as he was in apparent \\nindividual differences. \\nPure sensations, Wundt \\nsuggested, have three components: \\nquality, intensity, and “feeling-tone.” \\nFor example, a certain perfume may \\nhave a sweet odor (quality) that is \\ndistinct but faint (intensity) and is \\npleasant to smell (feeling-tone), \\nwhile a dead rat might give off a \\nnauseating (quality), strong \\n(intensity) stench (feeling-tone). All \\nconsciousness originates in \\nsensations, he said, but these are \\nnot internalized as “pure” sensory \\ndata; they are perceived as already \\ncollected or compounded into \\nrepresentations, such as a dead rat. \\nWundt called these “images of an \\nobject or of a process in the external \\nworld.” So, for example, if we see a \\nface with certain features—mouth \\nshape, eye color, nose size, and so \\non—we may recognize the face as  \\na person we know.\\nCategories of consciousness\\nBased on his sensory experiments, \\nWundt claimed that consciousness \\nconsists of three major categories \\nOur sensations provide details of \\nshape, size, color, smell, and texture, \\nbut when these are internalized, Wundt \\nsays, they are compounded into complex \\nrepresentations, such as a face.\\nof actions—representation, willing, \\nand feeling—which together form  \\nan impression of a unitary ﬂow of \\nevents. Representations are either \\n“perceptions,” if they represent an \\nimage in the mind of an object \\nperceived in the external world \\n(such as a tree within eyesight),  \\nor “intuitions” if they represent a \\nsubjective activity (such as \\nremembering a tree, or imagining  \\na unicorn). He named the process \\nthrough which a perception or \\nintuition becomes clear in \\nconsciousness “apperception.”  \\nSo, for example, you may perceive  \\na sudden loud noise and then \\napperceive that it is a warning sign, \\nmeaning that you are about to be \\nhit by a car if you don’t get out of \\nthe way quickly enough.\\nThe willing category of \\nconsciousness is characterized  \\nby the way it intervenes in the \\nexternal world; it expresses our \\nvolition, or “will,” from raising  \\nan arm to choosing to wear red. \\nThis form of consciousness is \\nbeyond experimental control or \\nmeasurement.

Each one \\nis “owned” by someone, and never \\n“comes into direct sight of a thought \\nin another personal consciousness \\nthan its own.” And it is these \\nthoughts “connected as we feel \\nthem to be connected” that form \\nthe self. As thoughts cannot be \\ndivided from the self, James said \\nthat investigating this self should \\nbe the starting point of psychology. \\nExperimental psychologists did not \\nagree, because “the self” cannot be \\noffered up for experimentation, but \\nJames thought it was enough to \\nwork with our understanding of a \\nself that does certain things and \\nfeels in certain ways. He called this \\nthe “empirical self,” which \\nmanifests itself through its \\nbehavior, and suggested that it \\nconsists of several parts—the \\nmaterial self, spiritual self, and \\nsocial self—each of which can be \\nstudied through introspection. \\nTheory of emotion\\nIn the early stages of his research \\ninto consciousness, James realized \\nthat the emotions play an important \\nrole in our daily lives, and went on to \\ndevelop, with his colleague Carl \\nLange, a theory about how they \\nrelate to our actions and behavior. \\nWhat was to become known as the \\nJames–Lange Theory of Emotion \\nstates that emotions arise from your \\nconscious mind’s perception of your \\nphysiological condition. To illustrate \\nthis theory, James used the example \\nof seeing a bear, then running away. \\nIt is not the case that you see the \\nbear, feel afraid, and then run away \\nbecause of the fear. What is really \\nhappening is that you see the bear \\nand run away, and the conscious \\nfeeling of fear is caused by the \\naction of running. This contradicts \\nwhat most people might think, but \\nJames’s view was that the mind’s \\nperception of the physical effects of \\nrunning—rapid breathing, increased \\nheartbeat, and perspiring heavily—\\nis translated into the emotion of fear. \\nAnother example, according to his \\ntheory, would be that you feel happy \\nbecause you are conscious that you \\nare smiling; it is not that you feel \\nhappy ﬁrst, and then smile.\\nPragmatism\\nRelated to James’s theories about \\nconsciousness is his approach to the \\nway we believe things to be true or \\nnot.

In the course of \\ntheir investigations, the Curies \\nfound that radium appeared to  \\ngive off unlimited amounts of \\nenergy, which “seemed for a \\nmoment to contradict our ideas of \\nthe whole order of nature.” \\nHowever, after conscious \\nconsideration of this revelation, \\nthey concluded that “although it \\nextends our old ideas of energy, it \\ncauses a minimum of alteration in \\ntheir nature.” In this instance, the \\nCuries’ scientiﬁc knowledge had \\nbeen questioned and modiﬁed, but \\nits core truths remained intact.\\nFurther studies\\nThe period following James’s death \\nsaw the rise of the behaviorist \\nmovement, and a decline of interest  \\nin consciousness. Consequently, \\nlittle theorizing on the subject \\nhappened from around the start of \\nthe 1920s up until the 1950s. One \\nimportant exception was the \\nGerman-based Gestalt movement, \\nwhich emphasized that the brain \\noperates in a holistic way, taking \\naccount of whole conscious \\nexperiences, rather than separate \\nevents—just as when we look at a \\npicture, we see not just separate \\ndots, lines, and shapes, but a \\nmeaningful whole. This concept  \\nis behind the now famous Gestalt \\nphrase: “The whole is greater than \\nthe sum of the parts.”\\nSince the 1980s, however, \\npsychologists and neuroscientists \\nhave developed a new ﬁeld of \\nresearch called “consciousness \\nstudies,” focusing on two main \\nareas of interest: the content of \\nconsciousness, as reported by \\npeople who are considered to be \\nnormal and healthy; and the \\nconsciousness of people whose \\nstate of awareness has been \\nimpaired in some way. The latter \\ngroup includes cases, such as  \\nwhen the subject is in a “persistent \\nvegetative state” (PVS)—in which \\npatients in a coma are awake and \\nbreathing independently, but have \\napparently lost all higher brain \\nfunctions. The goal with both paths \\nof research is to try to ﬁnd ways of \\nPierre and Marie Curie’s research, \\nlike most scientiﬁc work, modiﬁed, rather \\nthan totally contradicted, earlier theories. \\nNew “truths,” James claimed, constantly \\nmodify our basic beliefs in a similar way.\\nassessing consciousness as \\nobjectively as possible, and  \\nto understand its underlying \\nmechanisms—both physical  \\nand psychological.\\nModern neuroscience has \\ndemonstrated that there are \\nmechanisms of consciousness.  \\nBy the closing years of the 20th \\ncentury, the British molecular \\nbiologist and biophysicist  \\nFrancis Crick was claiming that \\nconsciousness is related to a \\nspeciﬁc part of the brain—the \\nprefrontal cortex area, which is \\ninvolved in thought processes  \\nsuch as planning, problem-solving, \\nand the control of behavior. \\nResearch carried out by the \\nColombian neuroscientist Rodolfo \\nLinas links consciousness to  \\nthe activities of the thalamus in \\nconjunction with the cerebral \\ncortex.

James claimed his \\napproach helped to move \\nphilosophers and psychologists \\n“away from abstraction, ﬁxed \\nprinciples, closed systems, and \\npretended absolutes and origins, \\ntowards facts, action, and power.” \\nHis insistence on focusing on the \\nwholeness of events, including the \\neffects of different environments  \\non our actions—in contrast to the \\nintrospective, structuralist approach \\nof breaking down our experiences \\ninto small details—has also shaped \\nour understanding of behavior. \\nBefore James started teaching the \\nsubject at Harvard in 1875, there \\nwere no independent psychology \\ncourses available in any American \\nuniversity.

Stanley Hall, in his \\n1904 book Adolescence, was the \\nﬁrst academic to explore the subject. \\nHall was inﬂuenced by Darwin’s \\ntheory of evolution, believing that \\nall childhoods, especially with \\nregard to behavior and early \\nphysical development, reﬂect the \\ncourse of evolutionary change, and \\nthat we each develop in accordance \\nwith our “ancestral record.”\\nOne key inﬂuence on Hall  \\nwas the 18th-century Sturm \\nund Drang (“Storm and Stress”) \\nmovement of German writers  \\nand musicians, which promoted \\ntotal freedom of expression. Hall \\nreferred to adolescence as “Sturm \\nund Drang;” he considered it a stage \\nof emotional turmoil and rebellion, \\nwith behavior ranging from quiet \\nmoodiness to wild risk-taking. \\nAdolescence, he stated, “craves \\nstrong feelings and new sensations… \\nmonotony, routine, and detail are \\nintolerable.” Awareness of self and \\nthe environment greatly increases; \\neverything is more keenly felt, and \\nsensation is sought for its own sake.\\nModern echoes\\nMany of Hall’s ﬁndings are echoed \\nin research today. Hall believed that \\nadolescents are highly susceptible \\nto depression, and described a \\n“curve of despondency” that starts \\nat the age of 11, peaks at 15, then \\nfalls steadily until the age of 23. \\nModern research acknowledges  \\na similar pattern. The causes of \\ndepression that Hall identiﬁed are \\nstartlingly familiar: suspicion of \\nbeing disliked and having seemingly \\ninsuperable character faults, and \\n“the fancy of hopeless love.” He \\nbelieved the self-consciousness of \\nadolescence leads to self-criticism \\nand censoriousness of self and \\nothers. This view mirrors later \\nstudies, which argue that teenagers’ \\nadvanced reasoning skills allow \\nthem to “read between the lines,” \\nwhile also magnifying their \\nsensitivity to situations. Even Hall’s \\nclaim that criminal activity is more \\nprevalent in the teenage years, \\npeaking around 18, still holds true.\\nBut Hall was not totally negative \\nabout adolescence. As he wrote in \\nYouth: Its Education, Regiment,  \\nand Hygiene, “Adolescence is a \\nnew birth, for the higher and more \\ncompletely human traits are now \\nborn.” So, for Hall, adolescence  \\nwas in fact a necessary beginning \\nof something much better. \\n■ \\nG.

Philosophers such as \\nJohn Locke and David Hume had \\nargued that remembering involves \\nassociation—linking things or \\nideas by shared characteristics, \\nsuch as time, place, cause, or \\neffect. Ebbinghaus tested the effect \\nof association on memory, recording \\nthe results mathematically to see if \\nmemory follows veriﬁable patterns.\\nMemory experiments\\nEbbinghaus started by memorizing \\nlists of words and testing how \\nmany he could recall. To avoid the \\nuse of association, he then created \\n2,300 “nonsense syllables,” all three \\nletters long and using the standard \\nword format of consonant–vowel–\\nconsonant: for example, “ZUC” and \\n“QAX.” Grouping these into lists, \\nhe looked at each syllable for a \\nfraction of a second, pausing for 15 \\nseconds before going through a list \\nagain. He did this until he could \\nrecite a series correctly at speed. \\nHe tested different list lengths and \\ndifferent learning intervals, noting \\nthe speed of learning and forgetting.\\nEbbinghaus found that he could \\nremember meaningful material, \\nsuch as a poem, ten times more \\neasily than his nonsense lists. He \\nalso noted that the more times the \\nstimuli (the nonsense syllables) \\nwere repeated, the less time was \\nneeded to reproduce the memorized \\ninformation. Also, the ﬁrst few \\nrepetitions proved the most \\neffective in memorizing a list.\\nWhen looking at his results for \\nevidence of forgetting, Ebbinghaus \\nfound, unsurprisingly, that he \\ntended to forget less quickly the \\nlists that he had spent the most \\ntime memorizing, and that recall is \\nbest performed immediately after \\nlearning. Ebbinghaus also uncovered \\nan unexpected pattern in memory \\nretention. He found that there is \\ntypically a very rapid loss of recall \\nin the ﬁrst hour, followed by a \\nslightly slower loss, so that after \\nnine hours, about 60 percent is \\nforgotten. After 24 hours, about \\ntwo-thirds of anything memorized \\nis forgotten. Plotted on a graph, this \\nshows a distinct “forgetting curve” \\nthat starts with a sharp drop, \\nfollowed by a shallow slope.\\nEbbinghaus’s research launched \\na new ﬁeld of enquiry, and helped \\nestablish psychology as a scientiﬁc \\ndiscipline. His meticulous methods \\nremain the basis of all psychological \\nexperimentation to this day. \\n■  \\nHermann Ebbinghaus Hermann Ebbinghaus was born in \\nBarmen, Germany, to a family of \\nLutheran merchants. At 17, he \\nbegan to study philosophy at \\nBonn University, but his academic \\ncareer was disrupted in 1870 by \\nthe Franco-Prussian War. In 1873, \\nhe completed his studies and \\nmoved to Berlin, later traveling to \\nFrance and England, where he \\ncarried out research on the power \\nof his own memory, starting in \\n1879. He published Memory in \\n1885, detailing the “nonsense \\nsyllable” research, and in the \\nsame year became a professor at \\nBerlin University, where he set up \\ntwo psychology laboratories  \\nand founded an academic \\njournal.

The shift from “mind” to \\n“behavior” as a basis for the study of \\npsychology was revolutionary, and \\nwas even accompanied by a \\n“behaviorist manifesto”—the paper \\nPsychology as the Behaviorist Views \\nIt, delivered in 1913 by Watson. \\nIn the US, which was leading the \\nﬁeld in psychology, behaviorism \\nbecame the dominant approach for \\nthe next 40 years. Evolving from \\nthe idea of Pavlovian or classical \\nconditioning came Watson’s \\nassertion that environmental \\nstimuli alone shape behavior; \\ninnate or inherited factors are not \\ninvolved. The next generation \\nincluded the “radical behaviorist” \\nB.F. Skinner, who proposed a \\nrethink of the stimulus–response \\nnotion in his theory of “operant \\nconditioning”—which stated that \\nbehavior was shaped by \\nconsequences, not by a preceding \\nstimulus. Although the concept \\nwas similar to ideas proposed by \\nWilliam James, it radically altered \\nthe course of behaviorism, taking \\ninto account genetic factors and \\nexplaining mental states as a result \\n(rather than as a cause) of behavior.\\nThe cognitive revolution\\nBy the mid-20th century, however, \\npsychologists were questioning the \\nbehaviorist approach. Ethology, the \\nstudy of animal behavior, showed \\nthe importance of instinctive as well \\nas learned behavior—a ﬁnding that \\nsat uncomfortably with strict ideas \\nof conditioning. A reaction to \\nSkinner’s ideas also sparked the \\n“cognitive revolution,” which  \\nturned attention once again from \\nbehavior back to the mind and \\nmental processes. A key ﬁgure at \\nthis time was Edward Tolman,  \\na behaviorist whose theories  \\nhad not dismissed the importance \\nof perception and cognition, due  \\nto his interest in German-based  \\nGestalt psychology. Advances in \\nneuroscience, explored by another \\nbehaviorist, Karl Lashley, also \\nplayed a part in shifting the \\nemphasis from behavior to  \\nthe brain and its workings.\\nBehaviorism had now run its \\ncourse, and was superseded by the \\nvarious branches of cognitive \\npsychology. However, its legacy, \\nparticularly in establishing a \\nscientiﬁc methodology for the \\nsubject, and in providing models \\nthat could be used in psychological \\nexperimentation, was a lasting one. \\nBehavioral therapy is also still in \\nuse today, as an essential part of \\ncognitive-behavioral therapy. \\n■\\nBEHAVIORISM\\n1943\\nClark L.

He referred to his brand of \\nS-R learning as “connectionism,” \\nasserting that the connections \\nmade during learning are “stamped \\nin” the circuitry of the brain.\\nWhat Thorndike proposed was \\nthat it is the outcome of an action \\nthat determines how strongly or \\nweakly the stimulus-response \\nconnection is stamped in; in the \\ncase of the puzzle boxes, whether \\npulling a string or pushing a panel \\nresulted in escape or frustration.  \\nIn other words, when particular \\nstimulus-response sequences are \\nfollowed by a satisfying or pleasant \\nstate of affairs (such as escape or a \\nreward), those responses tend to \\nbecome “more ﬁrmly connected \\nwith the situation, so that, when it \\nrecurs, they will be more likely to \\nrecur.” They become “stamped in” \\nas a neural connection.

Thorndike showed that \\nthe only signiﬁcant difference was in \\nspeed of learning, not memory. \\nstimulus-response connections  \\nthat are repeated are strengthened, \\nwhile those that are not used again \\nare weakened. Moreover, the rate  \\nat which connections strengthen  \\nor weaken can vary. According  \\nto Thorndike, “the greater the \\nsatisfaction or discomfort, the \\ngreater the strengthening or \\nweakening of the bond.”\\nInterestingly, although \\nThorndike was studying animal \\nbehavior using what were to \\nbecome standard behaviorist \\nmethods —and authoring a book, \\nAnimal Intelligence (1911), which \\nwas to become a classic of early \\nbehaviorism—he considered \\nhimself primarily an educational \\npsychologist. He had originally \\nintended to examine animal \\nintelligence, not behavior. He \\nwanted to show, for example, that \\nanimals learned by simple trial  \\nand error rather than by using a \\nfaculty of insight, an idea that was \\nprevalent in psychology at the time: \\n“In the ﬁrst place, most of the books \\ndo not give us a psychology, but \\nrather a eulogy of animals. They \\nhave all been about animal \\nintelligence, never about animal \\nstupidity,” he wrote. The fact that \\nhis cats in puzzle boxes learned \\ngradually, rather than suddenly  \\ngaining an insight into how to \\nescape, conﬁrmed his theories.  \\nThe animals were forced to learn  \\nby trial and error, because they \\nwere unable to use reason to work \\nout the link between the door and \\nthe operating handle.\\nHuman intelligence\\nAfter the publication of Animal \\nIntelligence, Thorndike turned his \\nattention to human intelligence.  \\nIn his opinion, the most basic \\nintelligence is characterized by \\nsimple stimulus and response \\nassociation, resulting in a neural \\nconnection. The more intelligent  \\nan animal, the more capable it will \\nbe of making such connections. \\nTherefore, intelligence can be \\ndeﬁned in terms of the ability to \\nform neural bonds, which is \\ndependent not only on genetic \\nfactors, but also on experience. \\nTo ﬁnd a measurement of \\nhuman intelligence, Thorndike \\ndevised his CAVD (Completion, \\nArithmetic, Vocabulary, and \\nDirections) test. It became the \\nmodel for all modern intelligence \\ntests, and assessed mechanical \\nintelligence (understanding of how \\nthings work), as well as abstract \\nintelligence (creative ability) and \\nsocial intelligence (interpersonal \\nskills). Thorndike was especially \\ninterested in how age might affect \\nlearning, and also proposed a \\ntheory of learning that remains at \\nthe heart of educational psychology \\nto this day, a contribution that is \\nperhaps what Thorndike would \\nhave wished more than anything \\nelse to be remembered for. However, \\nit is for his enormous inﬂuence on \\nthe behaviorist movement that \\nThorndike is most often lauded. \\n■\\nEdward Thorndike\\nThe son of a Methodist \\nminister, Edward Thorndike \\nwas born in Williamsburg, \\nMassachusetts, USA, in 1874. \\nHe graduated in sciences from \\nWesleyan University in 1895, \\nproceeding to Harvard to \\nstudy psychology under \\nWilliam James.

As with \\nso many great insights, this may \\nappear to be self-evident, but it \\nmarked a major turning point in \\nbehaviorist psychology.\\nSkinner boxes\\nWhile working as a research fellow \\nat Harvard, Skinner carried out a \\nseries of experiments on rats, using \\nan invention that later became \\nknown as a “Skinner box.” A rat \\nwas placed in one of these boxes, \\nwhich had a special bar ﬁtted on \\nthe inside. Every time the rat \\npressed this bar, it was presented \\nwith a food pellet. The rate of  \\nbar-pressing was automatically \\nrecorded. Initially, the rat might \\npress the bar accidentally, or  \\nsimply out of curiosity, and as a \\nconsequence receive some food. \\nOver time, the rat learned that food \\nappeared whenever the bar was \\npressed, and began to press it \\npurposefully in order to be fed. \\nComparing results from rats given \\nthe “positive reinforcement” of food \\nfor their bar-pressing behavior with \\nthose that were not, or were \\npresented with food at different \\nrates, it became clear that when \\nfood appeared as a consequence  \\nof the rat’s actions, this inﬂuenced \\nits future behavior.\\nSkinner concluded that animals \\nare conditioned by the responses \\nthey receive from their actions  \\nand environment.

It is not uncommon for \\npatients to ﬁnd themselves moved \\nto tears by an issue from many \\nyears ago that they felt they had \\nlong since “got over.” This response \\ndemonstrates that the event and the \\nemotion are still alive—still holding \\nemotional energy—and have been \\nrepressed rather than dealt with. \\nIn Freudian terms, “catharsis” \\ndescribes the act of releasing  \\nand feeling the deep emotions \\nassociated with repressed \\nmemories. If the signiﬁcant  \\nevent—such as the death of a \\nparent—was not fully experienced \\nat the time because it was too \\noverwhelming, the difﬁculty and \\nthe energy remain, to be released  \\nat the moment of catharsis. \\nSchool of psychoanalysis\\nFreud founded the prominent \\nPsychoanalytic Society in Vienna, \\nfrom which he exerted his  \\npowerful inﬂuence on the mental \\nhealth community of the time, \\ntraining others in his methods and \\nacting as the authority on what  \\nwas acceptable practice. Over  \\ntime, his students and other \\nprofessionals modiﬁed his ideas, \\neventually splitting the Society  \\ninto three: the Freudians (who \\nremained true to Freud’s original \\nthoughts), the Kleinians (who \\nfollowed the ideas of Melanie  \\nKlein), and the Neo-Freudians  \\n(a later group who incorporated \\nFreud’s ideas into their broader \\npractice).

They allow us to recognize \\na particular set of behaviors or \\nemotional expressions as a uniﬁed \\npattern that has meaning. It seems \\nthat we do this instinctively, but \\nJung says that what seems to be \\ninstinct is actually the unconscious \\nuse of archetypes. \\nJung suggests that the psyche \\nis composed of three components: \\nthe ego, the personal unconscious, \\nSee also: Pierre Janet 54–55  ■  Sigmund Freud 92–99  ■  Jaques Lacan 122–23  ■  Steven Pinker 211  \\nPSYCHOTHERAPY\\nand the collective unconscious.  \\nThe ego, he says, represents the \\nconscious mind or self, while the \\npersonal unconscious contains  \\nthe individual’s own memories, \\nincluding those that have been \\nsuppressed. The collective \\nunconscious is the part of the \\npsyche that houses the archetypes. \\nThe archetypes\\nThere are many archetypes, and \\nthough they can blend and mold \\ninto each other in different cultures, \\neach of us contains within us the \\nmodel of each archetype. Since we \\nuse these symbolic forms to make \\nsense of the world and our \\nexperiences, they appear in all \\nhuman forms of expression, such  \\nas art, literature, and drama. \\nThe nature of an archetype is \\nsuch that we recognize it instantly \\nand are able to attach to it a speciﬁc, \\nemotional meaning. Archetypes \\ncan be associated with many kinds \\nof behavioral and emotional \\npatterns, but there are certain \\nprominent ones that are highly \\nrecognizable, such as The Wise Old \\nMan, The Goddess, The Madonna, \\nthe Great Mother, and The Hero. \\nThe Persona is one of the most \\nimportant archetypes described by \\nJung. He recognized early in his \\nown life that he had a tendency to \\nshare only a certain part of his \\npersonality with the outside world. \\nHe also recognized this trait in \\nother people, and noted that human \\nbeings divide their personalities \\ninto components, selectively \\nsharing only certain components  \\nof their selves according to the \\nenvironment and situation. The self \\nthat we present to the world—our \\npublic image—is an archetype, \\nwhich Jung calls the “Persona.” \\nJung believes that the self has  \\nboth masculine and feminine  \\nparts, and is molded into  \\nbecoming fully male or female by \\nsociety as much as biology. When \\nwe become wholly male or female \\nwe turn our backs on half of our \\npotential, though we can still \\naccess this part of the self through \\nan archetype. The Animus exists \\nas the masculine component of the \\nfemale personality, and the Anima \\nas the feminine attributes of the \\nmale psyche. This is the “other \\nhalf,” the half that was taken from \\nus as we grew into a girl or boy. \\nThese archetypes help us to \\nunderstand the nature of the \\nopposite sex, and because they \\ncontain “deposits of all the \\nimpressions ever made” by a man \\nor woman, so they necessarily \\nreﬂect the traditional ideas of  \\nmasculine and feminine. \\n❯❯ \\nEve is one representation of the \\nAnima, the female part of a man’s \\nunconscious.

As \\nthese archetypes exist in our \\nunconscious, they can affect our \\nmoods and reactions, and can \\nmanifest themselves as prophetic \\nstatements (Anima) or unbending \\nrationality (Animus).\\nJung deﬁnes one archetype as \\nrepresenting the part of ourselves \\nwe do not want the world to see. He \\ncalls it the Shadow, and it is the \\nopposite of the Persona, representing \\nall our secret or repressed thoughts \\nand the shameful aspects of our \\ncharacter.

The Shadow is \\nthe “bad” side of ourselves that we \\nproject onto others, and yet it is not \\nentirely negative; it may represent \\naspects that we choose to suppress \\nonly because they are unacceptable \\nin a particular situation. \\nOf all the archetypes, the most \\nimportant is the True Self. This is a \\ncentral, organizing archetype that \\nattempts to harmonize all other \\naspects into a uniﬁed, whole self. \\nAccording to Jung, the real goal of \\nhuman existence is to achieve an \\nadvanced, enlightened psychological \\nstate of being that he refers to as \\n“self-realization,” and the route to \\nthis lies in the archetype of the \\nTrue Self. When fully realized, this \\narchetype is the source of wisdom \\nand truth, and is able to connect \\nthe self to the spiritual. Jung \\nstressed that self-realization does \\nnot happen automatically, it must \\nbe consciously sought. \\nArchetypes in dreams\\nThe archetypes are of signiﬁcant \\nimportance in the interpretation  \\nof dreams. Jung believed that \\ndreams are a dialogue between the \\nconscious self and the eternal (the \\nego and the collective unconscious), \\nand that the archetypes operate  \\nas symbols within the dream, \\nfacilitating the dialogue. \\nThe archetypes have speciﬁc \\nmeanings in the context of dreams. \\nFor instance, the archetype of The \\nWise Old Man or Woman may be \\nrepresented in a dream by a \\nspiritual leader, parent, teacher, or \\ndoctor—it indicates those who offer \\nguidance, direction, and wisdom. \\nThe Great Mother, an archetype \\nwho might appear as the dreamer’s \\nown mother or grandmother, \\nrepresents the nurturer. She \\nprovides reassurance, comfort, and \\nvalidation. The Divine Child, the \\narchetype that represents your True \\nSelf in its purest form, symbolizing \\ninnocence or vulnerability, would \\nappear as a baby or child in \\ndreams, suggesting openness or \\npotential. And lest the ego grow  \\ntoo large, it is kept in check by the \\nappearance of the Trickster, a \\nplayful archetype that exposes the \\ndreamer’s vulnerabilities and plays \\njokes, preventing the individual \\nfrom taking himself and his desires \\ntoo seriously. The Trickster also \\nDr. Jekyll transforms into the evil \\nMr. Hyde in a story by Robert Louis \\nStevenson that explores the idea of the \\n“darker self,” through a character that \\nembodies Jung’s Shadow archetype.\\nAll the most powerful  \\nideas in history go back  \\nto archetypes. \\nCarl Jung'),\n",

Literature, religion, and \\nart are ﬁlled with tales of good and \\nevil, of friend and foe. Newtonian \\nphysics states that stability or \\nbalance is achieved through one \\nforce being countered by an equal \\nand opposite force. Such opposing \\nforces appear to be an essential \\npart of existence, and perhaps  \\nthe most powerful of them are  \\nthe instinctive drives we have  \\nfor life and death. \\nSigmund Freud said that to \\navoid being destroyed by our own \\ndeath instinct, we employ our \\nnarcissistic or self-regarding life \\ninstinct (libido) to force the death \\ninstinct outward, directing it \\nagainst other objects. Melanie Klein \\nexpanded on this, saying that even \\nas we redirect the death force \\noutward, we still sense the danger \\nof being destroyed by “this instinct \\nof aggression;” we acknowledge the \\nhuge task of “mobilizing the libido” \\nagainst it. Living with these \\nopposing forces is an inherent \\npsychological conﬂict that is \\ncentral to human experience.  \\nKlein claimed that our tendencies \\ntoward growth and creation—from \\nprocreation to creativity—are \\nforced to run constantly against an \\nequally powerful and destructive \\nforce, and that this ongoing psychic \\ntension underlies all suffering. \\nKlein also stated that this \\npsychic tension explains our innate \\ntendency toward aggression and \\nviolence.

It is driven entirely by desire, \\nseeking pleasure and the fulﬁlment \\nof basic drives (such as food, comfort, \\nwarmth, and sex). The superego, like \\na righteous presence, calls us to \\nfollow the higher path. It imposes \\nparental and societal values and tells \\nus what we should and should not \\ndo. Lastly, the ego—like a decision-\\nmaking adult—controls impulses \\nand forms judgments on how to act; \\nit is the moderator, suspended \\nbetween the id and the superego. \\nAustrian psychoanalyst Anna \\nFreud expanded upon her father’s \\nideas, drawing attention to the \\nformation of the superego and its \\neffects upon the ego. The ego  \\ntakes account of the realities of the \\nworld, and is also simultaneously \\nengaged with the id and relegated \\nto an inferior position by the \\nsuperego.

Once  \\nwe understand that our perception \\nshapes our experience, we can  \\nsee how the roles we play and the \\nactions we take are tools, which \\nwe can then use consciously for \\nchanging reality. Control of our own \\ninner psychic environment gives us \\npower through two layers of choice: \\nin how to interpret the environment, \\nand how to react to it. The adage, \\n“no one can make you angry other \\nthan yourself,” perfectly exempliﬁes \\nthis philosophy, and its truth can \\nbe seen played out in the different \\nways that people react to trafﬁc \\njams, bad news, or personal \\ncriticism, for example. \\nIn Gestalt therapy, a person is \\nforced to take direct responsibility \\nfor how he or she acts and reacts, \\nregardless of what may seem to be \\nhappening.

This ability, to “be here \\nnow” is critical to the Gestalt \\nprocess; it is an acute emotional \\nawareness, and one that forms the \\nfoundation for understanding how \\neach of us creates and reacts to our \\nown environment. It also offers a \\npathway for learning how to change \\nthe ways we experience ourselves \\nand our environment. \\nAs a tool for personal growth, \\nthe ability to get in touch with \\nauthentic feelings—true thoughts \\nand emotions—is more important \\nto Perls than the psychological \\nexplanations or analytic feedback \\nof other forms of therapy. The  \\n“why” behind behavior holds  \\nlittle signiﬁcance for Perls; what  \\nis important is the “how” and \\n“what.” This devaluing of the need \\nto ﬁnd out “why” and the shift of \\nresponsibility for meaning from \\nanalyst to patient brought with it a \\nprofound change in the therapist–\\npatient hierarchy. Where previous \\napproaches in therapy generally \\ninvolved a therapist manipulating \\nthe patient toward the therapeutic \\ngoal, the Gestalt approach is \\ncharacterized by a warm, empathic \\nrelationship between therapist and \\npatient, who work together as \\npartners toward the goal. The \\ntherapist is dynamic but does not \\nlead the patient; the Gestalt \\napproach of Perls would later form \\nthe basis of Carl Rogers’ humanistic, \\nperson-centered approach.\\nA denial of fate\\nAnother component in the Gestalt \\nmethod involves the use of language. \\nOne critical tool patients are given \\nfor increasing self-awareness is the \\ninstruction to notice and change the \\nuse of the word “I” within speech. \\nPerls says that to take responsibility \\nfor our reality, we must recognize \\nhow we use language to give the \\nillusion that we have no control \\nwhen this is not the case. By simply \\nrephrasing “I can’t do that” to “I \\nwon’t do that,” it becomes clear that \\nI am making a choice. This also \\nhelps to establish ownership of \\nfeeling; emotions arise in and belong \\nto me; I cannot blame someone or \\nsomething else for my feelings. \\nOther examples of language \\nchange include replacing the word \\n“should” with “want,” changing, for \\nexample, ”I should leave now” to “I \\nwant to leave now.” This also acts \\nto reveal the element of choice. As \\nLike Buddhism, Gestalt therapy \\nencourages the development of mindful \\nawareness and the acceptance of change \\nas inevitable.

The \\ndefenses, maintains Winnicott, \\nexplain the presence of hatred.  \\nThe child will “act out” in an \\noutburst of anger against the new \\nparental ﬁgure, expressing hatred \\nand, in turn, invoking hatred from \\nthe carer. He termed the behavior \\nan “antisocial tendency.”\\nAccording to Winnicott, for a \\nchild who has suffered, the need to \\nhate and be hated is deeper even \\nthan the need for rebellion, and the \\nimportance of the carer tolerating \\nthe hate is an essential factor in the \\nhealing of the child. Winnicott says \\nthat the child must be allowed to \\nexpress the hatred, and the parent \\nmust be able to tolerate both the \\nchild’s and their own hatred as well. \\nThe idea may be shocking, and \\npeople may struggle with the \\nnotion that they feel hatred rising \\nwithin them. They may feel guilty, \\nbecause the child has been through \\nsuch difﬁculties already. Yet the \\nchild is actively behaving hatefully \\ntoward the parent, projecting past \\nexperiences of being neglected and \\nignored onto present-day reality. \\nThe child of a broken home or \\nwithout parents, Winnicott says, \\n“spends his time unconsciously \\nlooking for his parents” and so \\nfeelings from past relationships  \\nare displaced onto another adult. \\nThe child has internalized the  \\nhate, and sees it even when it is  \\nno longer present. In his new \\nsituation, the child needs to see \\nwhat happens when hatred is in  \\nthe air. Winnicott explains: “What \\nhappens is that after a while a  \\nchild so adopted gains hope, and \\nthen he starts to test out the \\nenvironment he has found, and to \\nseek proof of his guardian’s ability \\nto hate objectively.”\\nThere are many ways for a  \\nchild to express hatred and prove \\nthat he or she is indeed not worthy \\nof being loved. This worthlessness \\nis the message that was imparted \\nby earlier, negative parental \\nexperiences. From the child’s point \\nof view, he is attempting to protect \\nhimself from the risk of ever having \\nto feel love or to be loved because of \\nthe potential disappointment that \\naccompanies that state of being.\\nDONALD WINNICOTT\\nDealing with the hatred\\nThe emotions that the child’s \\nhatred invokes in the parents, as \\nwell as in the child’s teachers and \\nother authority ﬁgures, are very \\nreal. Winnicott believes that it is \\nessential that adults acknowledge \\nthese feelings, rather than deny \\nthem, which might seem easier. \\nThey also need to understand  \\nthat the child’s hatred is not \\npersonal; the child is expressing \\nanxiety about his previous unhappy \\nsituation with the person who  \\nis now at hand. \\nWhat the authority ﬁgure does \\nwith their own hatred, of course, is \\nof critical importance. The child’s \\nbelief that he or she is “bad” and \\nunworthy of being loved must not \\nbe reinforced by the response from \\nthe adult; the adult must simply \\ntolerate the feelings of hatred and \\nrealize that these feelings are part \\nof the relationship. This is the only \\nway the child will feel secure and \\nbe able to form an attachment. \\nNo matter how loving a new \\nenvironment may be, it does not \\nerase the past for the child; there \\nwill still be residual feelings as a \\nresult of their past experience. \\nWinnicott sees no short cuts to a \\nIt seems that an  \\nadopted child can  \\nbelieve in being loved only \\nafter reaching being hated.\\nDonald Winnicott\\nThe “antisocial tendency” in \\nchildren is a way they express \\nanxieties about their world, testing out \\ntheir caregivers who must continue to \\nprovide a supportive and caring home.'),\n",

The child is expecting \\nthat the adult’s feelings of hatred \\nwill lead to rejection, because that \\nis what has happened before; when \\nthe hatred does not lead to rejection  \\nand is tolerated instead, it can \\nbegin to dissipate. \\nHealthy hatred\\nEven in psychologically healthy \\nfamilies with children who have not \\nbeen displaced, Winnicott believes \\nunconscious hatred is a natural, \\nessential part of the parenting \\nexperience and speaks of “hating \\nappropriately.” Melanie Klein had \\nsuggested that a baby feels hatred \\nfor its mother, but Winnicott \\nproposes that this is preceded by \\nthe mother hating the baby—and \\nthat even before this, there is an \\nextraordinary primitive or \\n“ruthless” love. The baby’s \\nexistence places huge demands  \\non the mother psychologically and \\nphysically and these evoke feelings \\nof hatred in the mother. Winnicott’s \\nlist of 18 reasons why the mother \\nhates the baby include: that the \\npregnancy and birth have \\nendangered her life; that the baby \\nis an interference with her private \\nlife; that the baby hurts her when \\nnursing, even biting her; and that \\nthe baby “treats her as scum, an \\nunpaid servant, a slave.” Despite all \\nof this she also loves him, “excretions \\nand all,” says Winnicott, with a \\nhugely powerful, primitive love, and \\nhas to learn how to tolerate hating \\nher baby without in any way acting \\non it. If she cannot hate appropriately, \\nhe claims, she turns the feelings of \\nhatred toward herself, in a way that \\nis masochistic and unhealthy.\\nTherapeutic relationship\\nWinnicott also used the \\nrelationship between the parent \\nand child as an analogy for the \\ntherapeutic relationship between \\ntherapist and client. The feelings \\nthat arise in a therapist during \\nanalysis are part of a phenomenon \\nknown as “countertransference.” \\nFeelings that are aroused in the \\nclient during therapy—usually \\nfeelings about parents or siblings—\\nare transferred onto the therapist. \\nIn his paper, Winnicott described \\nhow as part of the analysis, the \\ntherapist feels hate toward the \\nclient, though this hate was \\nPSYCHOTHERAPY\\ngenerated by the patient as a \\nnecessary part of testing that the \\ntherapist can bear it. The patient \\nneeds to know that the therapist  \\nis strong and reliable enough to \\nwithstand this onslaught. \\nA realistic approach\\nWhile some of Winnicott’s ideas \\nmay appear shocking, he believes \\nwe should be realistic about \\nbringing up children, avoiding \\nsentimentality in favor of honesty. \\nThis enables us as children, and \\nlater as adults, to acknowledge  \\nand deal with natural, unavoidable \\nnegative feelings. Winnicott is a \\nrealist and pragmatist; he refuses \\nto believe in the mythical idea of \\n“the perfect family” or in a world \\nwhere a few kind words wipe  \\naway all of the horrors that may \\nhave preceded it. He prefers to  \\nsee the real environment and \\nmental states of our experience, \\nand asks us to do likewise, with \\ncourageous honesty.

Fromm’s concept of love  \\nis vastly different from popular \\nunderstandings of the word. To \\nFromm, love is not an emotion, nor \\nis it dependent on ﬁnding an object \\nto love. It is an interpersonal \\ncreative capacity that one must \\nactively develop as part of one’s \\npersonality. He says “it is an \\nattitude, an ordination of character \\nwhich determines the relatedness \\nof the person to the whole world.” \\nIn terms of personal love for \\nanother, Fromm says that the main \\ntenets are care, responsibility, \\nrespect, and knowledge—an \\nobjective knowledge of what other \\npeople truly want and need. Love  \\nis only possible through respecting \\nthe separateness and uniqueness  \\nof ourselves and of another; \\nparadoxically, this is how we develop \\nthe ability to create connectedness. \\nLove demands a great amount of \\nrespect for the other person as an \\nindividual, and it is based on \\nautonomy, not a blending of \\npersonalities. In our overwhelming \\ndesire to connect and unify, we try \\nto love but our relationships often \\nresult in an unloving imbalance. \\nWe think we are loving, but in \\nreality we may be seeking another \\nform of conformity. We say “I love \\nyou” when really we mean “I see \\nme in you,” “I will become you,” or \\n“I will possess you.” In loving, we \\ntry to lose our uniqueness, or steal \\nit from the other person. Our \\nyearning to exist “as one” makes  \\nus want to see ourselves reﬂected \\nin other people, which in turn leads \\nus to artiﬁcially impose our own \\ntraits onto someone else. \\n❯❯ \\nSee also: Alfred Adler 100–01  ■  Karen Horney 110  ■  Fritz Perls 112–17  ■  Carl Rogers 130–37  ■  Abraham Maslow 138–39  \\n■      Rollo May 141  \\nPSYCHOTHERAPY'),\n",

This is futile, because \\nonly a person who has a strong \\nsense of self, and can stand ﬁrmly \\nwithin their own understanding of \\nthe world, is able to give freely to \\nothers and love in an authentic way. \\nThose who tend to orient themselves \\ntoward receiving love instead of \\nbeing loving will fail; they will also \\nseek to establish a receiving \\nrelationship in other ways, always \\nwanting to be given things—\\nmaterial or immaterial—rather than \\nto give.

These beliefs are the \\nfoundation of an approach that \\nregards patients in an entirely \\npositive light, one of absolute, \\nunconditional acceptance. Rogers \\nasked that his patients learn to do \\nthe same for themselves and for \\nothers. This perspective, grounded \\nin compassion and the recognition \\nof the potential of each and every \\nindividual, is famously termed \\n“unconditional positive regard.” \\nRogers believed that all people,  \\nnot just his patients, needed to be \\nable to view themselves in this \\nway, as well as those around them  \\nand their environment. \\nUnconditional self-acceptance \\nand unconditional acceptance of \\nothers are vital, and when these  \\nare lacking, people fail to remain \\nopen to experience. Rogers \\nmaintained that many of  \\nus have very strong, strident, \\nspeciﬁc conditions that must be \\nmet before we will grant approval  \\nor acceptance. We also base  \\nself-worth and regard for others  \\non achievements or appearance, \\nrather than accepting people  \\nas they are. \\nParents may inadvertently  \\nteach children that they are  \\nworthy of affection only if certain \\nrequirements are met, offering \\nthem rewards and praise when  \\nthey eat their vegetables or get  \\nan A grade in physics, but fail  \\nto love them openly just for \\nthemselves. Rogers calls these \\nrequirements “conditions of worth,” \\nbelieving that the tendency of \\nhumankind to demand that  \\npeople and things match our \\narbitrary expectations does  \\nall of us a great disservice. \\n \\nAchievements are to be \\nrespected, he says, but they are \\nboth separate and secondary  \\nto acceptance, which is a basic  \\nhuman need, and does not have  \\nto be “earned” through deeds  \\nor action.

It was based on a positive \\nview of humanity as basically \\nTeaching a child to ride a bicycle \\nrequires encouragement and support \\nbut ultimately the child must be brave \\nand trust himself. Rogers likened his \\nperson-centered therapy to this process.\\nhealthy and capable of growing  \\nand realizing its potential. This \\napproach was in contrast to the \\nother main psychological therapies \\nof the time—psychoanalysis and \\nbehaviorism—both of which  \\nfocus on the pathology of the \\nindividual and how to ﬁx it. \\nRogers initially called his \\napproach “client-centered,” and then \\nchanged it to “person-centered,” and \\nit has since been hugely inﬂuential \\nin education, parenting, business, \\nand other areas as well as in clinical \\nwork. In person-centered therapy, \\nwhich Rogers described as “non-\\ndirective therapy,” the therapist \\ntakes the role of a facilitator who \\nhelps the client ﬁnd his or her own \\nanswers, based on the belief that \\nthe client knows himself best. In \\nperson-centered therapy, the client \\nidentiﬁes his problems and what \\ndirection the therapy should take. \\nFor example, the client may not \\nwish to focus on his childhood but \\nrather deal with issues he is facing \\nat work and the therapist may help \\nhim ﬁnd what sort of role he would \\nreally like to take. Rogers describes \\nthe process as “supportive, not \\nreconstructive;” the client must  \\nnot come to rely on the therapist  \\nfor support, but instead needs to \\nlearn how to become sufﬁciently \\nself-aware and self-trusting to  \\nbe independent and able to live \\n“the good life.”\\nRogers’ legacy\\nRogers was one of the most \\ninﬂuential psychotherapists of the \\n20th century, and his new client-\\ncentered, non-directive therapy \\nmarked a turning point in the \\ndevelopment of psychotherapy.  \\nHe was instrumental in the \\nencounter-group philosophy of  \\nthe 1960s, which encouraged  \\nopen communication between \\nindividuals.

One of the most \\ncommon ways in which irrationality \\noccurs, he says, is the tendency to \\ndraw extreme conclusions, \\nespecially negative ones, about \\nevents.

He believes that he is \\nworthless because he was ﬁred, \\nand that he will never ﬁnd another \\njob.

Ellis deﬁnes \\nrational thinking as helpful to the \\nself. It is based on tolerance and  \\nthe ability to bear distress without \\nassuming catastrophic negative \\nconclusions, and is rooted in a \\nbelief in positive human potential. \\nThis is not to say one turns a blind \\neye to negative factors in favor of \\nnaïve, positive beliefs—rational \\nthinking does acknowledge \\nreasonable feelings of sorrow, guilt, \\nand frustration. The rational thinker \\nmay lose her job; it may have even \\nbeen her fault that she lost the job, \\nbut she knows she is not worthless. \\nShe may be upset with herself, but \\nshe knows that rationally there is \\nthe possibility of another job. \\nRational thinking is balanced and \\nalways allows room for optimism \\nand possibilities; it creates healthy \\nemotional consequences. \\nEllis’s notion of irrational \\nthinking is inﬂuenced by Karen \\nHorney’s idea of the “tyranny of  \\nthe shoulds”—a preoccupation \\n❯❯\\n…react “automatically” and irrationally…\\nWhen negative things happen, \\nwe can…\\n…take time to consider a response…\\n…and think about new, rational ways  \\nto respond that may be useful \\nand beneﬁcial to us.\\nWe realize that our negative opinions  \\nare unjustiﬁed and the world holds  \\ninﬁnite possibilities for us.\\n…which reinforces habitual ways  \\nof thinking that may be  \\nunhelpful and not beneﬁcial to us.\\nWe become even more convinced that  \\nour poor opinions of ourselves \\nand the world are justiﬁed.'),\n",

Doctors \\nperform examinations and tests to \\ndiagnose physical illness, whereas \\npsychiatric diagnosis is based on \\nbehavior.

He argues that drugs \\nalso hinder the ability to think, and \\nas a result interfere with the natural \\nprocess of true recovery. \\nApproach to schizophrenia\\nLaing’s main work centers on the \\nunderstanding and treatment of \\nschizophrenia—a serious mental \\ndisorder characterized by severe \\ndisruptions in psychological \\nfunctioning—and on explaining it \\nto ordinary people.

We are constantly \\n“knitting” ourselves from people \\nand situations that we encounter, \\nthrough the words we exchange \\nand the feelings that arise. We \\nmight feel that if one “stitch” is \\ndropped, our lives will unravel. In \\nfact, “if just one stitch holds, we \\ncan start all over again.” \\nPositive emotions and humor are \\nkey factors in resilience. Cyrulnik’s \\nresearch has shown that people who \\nare better able to cope with life’s \\ndifﬁculties or traumas are able to \\nﬁnd meaning in hardship, seeing it \\nas a useful and enlightening \\nexperience, and even to ﬁnd ways \\nto laugh. Resilient people always \\nremain able to see how things may \\nturn out for the better in future, even \\nif the present is painful. \\nMeeting the challenge\\nIt had previously been thought that \\npeople who show more resilience \\nare less emotional in general, but \\nCyrulnik believed that the pain is \\nno less for resilient people than it is \\nfor others; it is a matter of how they \\nchoose to use it. The pain may \\ncontinue, even over a whole lifetime, \\nbut for these people it raises a \\nchallenge that they decide to meet. \\nThe challenge is to overcome what \\nhas happened, to ﬁnd strength in \\nthe experience instead of letting it \\ndefeat them, and to use the strength \\nto move deﬁantly forward. Given \\nthe right support, children are \\nespecially capable of complete \\nrecovery from trauma. Cyrulnik has \\nshown that the human brain is \\nmalleable and will recover if \\nallowed. The brain of a traumatized \\nchild shows shrinkage of the \\nventricles and cortex, but where the \\nchild is well supported and loved \\nafter the trauma, brain scans have \\nshown the brain to be capable of \\nreturning to normal within a year. \\nCyrulnik stresses the importance \\nof not labeling children who have \\nsuffered a trauma, thereby sidelining \\nthem to a seemingly hopeless future. \\nTrauma consists of the injury and \\nthe representation of that injury. \\nEnduring humiliating adult \\ninterpretations of events can be the \\nmost traumatic experience. Labels, \\nhe says, can be more damaging and \\ndamning than the experience. \\n■ \\nAfter disasters such as tsunamis \\npsychologists have witnessed the \\nformation of resilient communities, \\ncharacterized by the residents’ \\ndetermination to overcome adversity.\\n Resilience is  a person’s  \\nability  to grow in the face \\n of terrible problems.\\nBoris Cyrulnik\\nBoris Cyrulnik \\nBoris Cyrulnik was born to \\nJewish parents in Bordeaux, \\nFrance, shortly before the \\noutbreak of World War II.

Prominent among these \\nwas Karl Lashley, who led the way \\nin examining the role played by \\nneural connections, but it was his \\nstudent, the Canadian psychologist \\nDonald Hebb, who formulated a \\ntheory to explain what actually \\nhappens during the process of \\nassociative learning.\\nHebb argued that nerve cells \\nbecome associated when they are \\nsimultaneously and repeatedly \\nactive; the synapses, or links, that \\nconnect them become stronger.\\nRepeated experiences lead to the \\nformation of “cell assemblies,” or \\ngroups of connected neurons, in the \\nbrain—a theory often summed up \\nas “cells that ﬁre together, wire \\ntogether.” Similarly, separate cell \\nassemblies can also become linked, \\nforming a “phase sequence,” which \\nwe recognize as a thought process. \\nThis associative process, Hebb \\nfound, is especially noticeable in \\nchildhood learning, when new cell \\nassemblies and phase sequences \\nare being formed. In his book, The \\nOrganization of Behavior (1949), he \\ngave the example of a baby hearing \\nfootsteps, which stimulates a \\nnumber of neurons in its brain;  \\nif the experience is repeated, a  \\ncell assembly forms. Subsequently, \\n“when the baby hears footsteps…\\nan assembly is excited; while this \\nis still active he sees a face and \\nfeels hands picking him up, which \\nexcites other assemblies—so the \\n‘footsteps assembly’ becomes \\nconnected with the ‘face assembly’ \\nand with the ‘being-picked-up \\nassembly.’ After this has happened, \\nwhen the baby hears footsteps only, \\nall three assemblies are excited.”  \\nIn adults, however, learning tends \\nto involve the rearrangement  \\nof existing cell assemblies and  \\nphase sequences, rather than the \\nformation of new ones.\\nHebb’s theory of cell assembly \\nwas a cornerstone of modern \\nneuroscience, and his explanation \\nof neural learning, which became \\nknown as Hebbian learning, \\nremains the accepted model. \\n■   \\nIN CONTEXT\\nAPPROACH\\nNeuropsychology\\nBEFORE\\n1890 William James puts \\nforward a theory about neural \\nnetworks in the brain.\\n1911 Edward Thorndike’s \\nLaw of Effect proposes that \\nconnections between stimulus \\nand response are “stamped in,” \\ncreating a neural link, or \\nassociation. \\n1917 Wolfgang Köhler’s study \\nof chimps shows that learning \\nby insight is longer-lasting \\nthan learning by trial and error.\\n1929 Karl Lashley publishes \\nBrain Mechanisms and \\nIntelligence.\\nAFTER\\n1970s George Armitage Miller \\ncoins the term “cognitive \\nneuroscience.”  \\n1980s Neuroscientists devise \\nimaging techniques, allowing \\nthem to map brain functions. \\n      W H E N  A  B A B Y\\nHEARS FOOTSTEPS,\\n         AN ASSEMBLY\\nIS EXCITED\\n                     DONALD HEBB (1904–1985)\\nCOGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY'),\n",

In the course of his \\nresearch, Festinger observed that \\npeople continually seek to bring \\norder to their world, and a key part \\nof that order is consistency. To \\nachieve this, they develop routines \\nand habits, such as establishing \\nregular mealtimes and choosing \\nfavorite seats on their daily \\ncommute to work. When these \\nroutines are disrupted, people feel \\nvery uneasy. The same is true, he \\nfound, of habitual thought patterns \\nor beliefs. If a very strong opinion is \\nmet with contradictory evidence, it \\ncreates an uncomfortable internal \\ninconsistency; Festinger called this \\n“cognitive dissonance.” He reasoned \\nthat the only way to overcome this \\ndiscomfort is to somehow make the \\nbelief and the evidence consistent.\\n \\nUnshakeable conviction\\nAfter reading a report in a local \\nnewspaper in 1954, Festinger  \\nsaw an opportunity to study the \\nreaction to just such a cognitive \\ndissonance. A cult claimed to have \\nreceived messages from aliens \\nwarning of a ﬂood that would end \\nthe world on December 21; only \\ntrue believers would be rescued by \\nﬂying saucers. Festinger and some \\nof his colleagues at the University \\nof Minnesota gained access to the \\ngroup, interviewing them before \\nthe designated apocalyptic date \\nand again afterward, when the \\nevents had failed to transpire. \\nThe now-famous Oak Park  \\nstudy of this group, written up by \\nFestinger, Henry Riecken, and \\nStanley Schachter in When \\nProphecy Fails, describes the \\nreaction of the cult members. \\nWhere common sense might lead \\nus to expect that the failure of  \\nLeon Festinger Leon Festinger was born in \\nBrooklyn, New York, to a Russian \\nimmigrant family.

His background in \\nengineering meant that he would \\nnot be satisﬁed until he had \\nevidence on which to base a theory, \\nand he also wanted that research  \\nto have a practical application.  \\nThe APU was dedicated to applied \\npsychology, which for Broadbent \\nreferred not only to therapeutic \\napplications, but also to applications \\nthat beneﬁted society as a whole; \\nhe was always very conscious that \\nhis research was publicly funded.\\nOne voice at a time\\nOne of Broadbent’s most important \\nexperiments was suggested by his \\nexperience with air trafﬁc control. \\nGround crew often had to deal with \\nseveral streams of incoming \\ninformation simultaneously, sent \\nfrom planes arriving and departing, \\nwhich was relayed to the operators \\nby radio and received through \\nheadphones. The air trafﬁc \\ncontrollers then had to make quick \\ndecisions based on that information, \\nand Broadbent had noticed that they \\ncould only effectively deal with one \\nmessage at a time. What interested \\nhim was the mental process that \\nmust take place in order for them to \\nselect the most important message \\nfrom the various sources of incoming \\ninformation. He felt that there must \\nbe some kind of mechanism in the \\nbrain that processes the information \\nand makes that selection.\\nThe experiment that Broadbent \\ndevised, now known as the dichotic \\nlistening experiment, was one of \\nthe ﬁrst in the ﬁeld of selective \\nattention—the process our brains \\nuse to “ﬁlter out” the irrelevant \\ninformation from the masses of \\ndata we receive through our senses \\nall the time. Following the air trafﬁc \\ncontrol model, he chose to present \\naural (sound-based) information \\nthrough headphones to the subjects \\nof his experiment. The system was \\nset up so that he could relay two \\ndifferent streams of information at \\nthe same time—one to the left ear \\nand one to the right—and then test \\nthe subjects on their retention of \\nthat information.\\nAs Broadbent had suspected, the \\nsubjects were unable to reproduce \\nall the information from both \\nchannels of input. His feeling that \\nwe can only listen to one voice at \\nonce had been conﬁrmed, but still \\nthe question remained as to exactly \\nhow the subject had chosen to retain \\nsome of the incoming information \\nand effectively disregard the rest.\\nThinking back to his initial \\ntraining as an engineer, Broadbent \\nsuggested a mechanical model to \\nexplain what he felt was happening \\nin the brain. He believed that when \\nthere are multiple sources of input, \\nthey may reach a “bottleneck” if the \\nbrain is unable to continue to process \\nall the incoming information; at this \\npoint, there must be some kind of \\n“ﬁlter” that lets through only one \\nchannel of input. The analogy he \\nuses to explain this is typically \\npractical: he describes a Y-shaped \\ntube, into which two ﬂows of ping \\npong balls are channeled. At the \\njunction of the two branches of the \\ntube, there is a ﬂap that acts to \\nblock one ﬂow of balls or the other; \\nthis allows balls from the unblocked \\nchannel into the stem of the tube.\\nAir trafﬁc controllers have to deal \\nwith a multitude of simultaneous \\nsignals.

In a series of \\nexperiments that were variations \\non his original dichotic listening \\ntasks, Broadbent established that \\ninformation is received by the \\nsenses and then passed on in  \\nits entirety to some kind of store, \\nwhich he called the short-term \\nmemory store.

Another British scientist, \\nColin Cherry, also investigated the \\nsubject during the 1950s. Working \\nin communication rather than \\npsychology, Cherry posed what he \\ncalled the “cocktail party problem:” \\nhow, at a party where lots of people \\nare talking, do we select which of \\nmany conversations to give our \\nattention to, and which to ignore? \\nAnd how is it possible to be \\ndistracted from our focused \\nattention on conversation “A”  \\nby conversations “B” or “C”?\\nTo help answer these questions, \\nBroadbent turned his attention to \\nthe nature of the ﬁlter in his model. \\nPrecisely what information does  \\nit ﬁlter out, and what does it allow \\nthrough? Following another process \\nof rigorous experimenting, he found \\nthat the selection is made not on \\nthe content of the information (what \\nis being said), but on the physical \\ncharacteristics of any message, \\nsuch as clarity or tone of voice.  \\nThis suggests that even though \\ninformation is stored, albeit very \\nbrieﬂy, in short-term memory, it  \\nis only after ﬁltering that it is \\nprocessed for meaning and actually \\nunderstood. This ﬁnding had  \\nimportant implications when \\napplied to air trafﬁc control, for \\nexample, where decisions could  \\nbe made on possibly irrelevant or \\ninaccurate information, rather than \\nbeing prioritized according to \\nmeaning and importance. \\nBroadbent and Cherry worked \\ntogether on many dichotic listening \\nexperiments to test the ﬁltering \\nprocess. They realized that ﬁltering  \\nis also affected by expectation. In \\none experiment, participants were \\nasked to listen to different sets of \\nnumbers presented simultaneously \\nto each ear. In some cases they \\nwere instructed which ear (the \\ninformation channel) they would  \\nbe asked about ﬁrst; in others no \\ninstructions were given.

The implication, he \\nbelieved, is that the brain encodes \\neach memory for storage in long-term \\nmemory, so that speciﬁc memories \\ncan be located for recollection by a \\nmore general retrieval cue. The \\ncues that prompt episodic memory \\nare usually sensory. A speciﬁc sound, \\nsuch as a piece of music, or a scent \\ncan trigger a complete memory. \\nTulvings’s theory of the \\n“encoding speciﬁcity principle” \\nwas especially applicable to \\nepisodic memory. Memories of \\nspeciﬁc past events are encoded \\naccording to the time of their \\noccurrence, along with other \\nmemories of the same time. He \\nfound that the most effective cue \\nfor retrieving any speciﬁc episodic \\nmemory is the one which overlaps \\nwith it most, since this is stored \\ntogether with the memory to be \\nretrieved. Retrieval cues are \\nnecessary to access episodic \\nmemory, but not always sufﬁcient, \\nbecause sometimes the relationship \\nis not close enough to allow \\nrecollection, even though the \\ninformation is stored and available \\nin long-term memory.\\nUnlike previous theories of \\nmemory, Tulving’s encoding principle \\nmade a distinction between memory \\nthat is available and that which is \\naccessible. When someone is unable \\nto recall a piece of information, it \\ndoes not mean that it is “forgotten” \\nin the sense that it has faded or \\nsimply disappeared from long-term \\nmemory; it may still be stored, and \\ntherefore be available—the problem \\nis one of retrieval. \\nScanning for memory \\nTulving’s research into the storage \\nand retrieval of memory opened up \\na whole new area for psychological \\nstudy. The publication of his \\nﬁndings in the 1970s coincided \\nwith a new determination by many \\ncognitive psychologists to ﬁnd \\nconﬁrmation of their theories in \\nneuroscience, using brain-imaging \\ntechniques that had just become \\navailable. In conjunction with \\nneuroscientists, Tulving was able \\nto map the areas of the brain that \\nare active during encoding and \\nretrieval of memory, and establish \\nthat episodic memory is associated \\nwith the medial temporal lobe and, \\nspeciﬁcally, the hippocampus. \\nPartly due to his unorthodox \\nand untutored approach, Tulving \\nmade innovative insights that \\nproved inspirational to other \\npsychologists, including some of \\nhis former students such as Daniel \\nSchacter. Tulving’s focus on storage \\nand retrieval provided a new way of \\nthinking about memory, but it was \\nperhaps his distinction between \\nsemantic and episodic memory that \\nwas his breakthrough contribution. \\nIt allowed subsequent psychologists \\nto increase the complexity of the \\nmodel to include such concepts as \\nprocedural memory (remembering \\nhow to do something), and the \\ndifference between explicit memory \\n(of which we are consciously aware) \\nand implicit memory (of which we \\nhave no conscious awareness,  \\nbut which nonetheless continues  \\nto affect us).

Increasingly \\nsophisticated models of short- and \\nlong-term memory were developed, \\nin order to explain how information \\nis selected, organized, stored, and \\nretrieved. The ways in which \\nmemories could be forgotten or \\ndistorted were also identiﬁed.\\nMemory and mood \\nBy the 1970s, the focus in learning \\ntheory and memory had moved to \\ninvestigating why some memories \\nare better stored or more easily \\nretrieved than others. One of the \\nforemost psychologists in the ﬁeld, \\nGordon H. Bower, had noticed that \\nemotion appeared to impact on \\nmemory. Bower carried out studies \\nin which people learned lists of \\nwords while in different moods, and \\nlater had to recall them, again when \\nin varying emotional states. He \\nuncovered what he called “mood-\\ndependent retrieval:” whatever a \\nperson has learned when unhappy \\nis easier to recall when they are \\nagain unhappy. Bower concluded \\nthat we form an association between \\nour emotional state and what is \\ngoing on around us, and the emotion \\nand the information are stored in \\nmemory together. It is then easier to \\nrecall facts that we learned when \\nwe were in the same mood as we \\nare when recollecting them. \\nBower also discovered that \\nemotion plays a part in the type of \\ninformation that the brain stores. \\nWhen we are happy, he observed \\nthat we tend to notice—and \\ntherefore remember—positive \\nthings; when we are sad, negative \\nthings attract our attention and are \\ncommitted to memory more easily. \\nFor example, Bower found that \\nunhappy people recalled details of  \\na sad story better than those who \\nwere happy when they read it. He \\ncalled this “mood-congruent \\nprocessing,” and concluded that \\nepisodic memory—of events, not \\njust words or facts—is especially \\nlinked to emotions. The events and \\nemotions are stored together, and \\nwe remember best the events that \\nmatch our mood, both when they \\noccurred, and when recalling them. \\nBower’s ﬁndings led him to study \\npeople in various emotional states, \\nretrospectively observing their \\nvideotaped interactions with others. \\nMemory and judgement of past \\nbehavior varied with current mood. \\nThis research helped Bower to \\nreﬁne his ideas about emotion and \\nmemory, and inspired further \\npsychological examination of the \\nrole emotions play in our lives. \\n■ \\nGordon H.

The \\nidea came to him from interviewing \\npeople who appeared to get a lot \\nout of life, either in their work or \\ntheir leisure activities—not only \\ncreative professionals such as \\nartists and musicians, but people \\nfrom all walks of life, including \\nsurgeons and business leaders, and \\nthose who found satisfaction in \\npursuits such as sports and games. \\nCsíkszentmihályi found that all \\nthese people described a similar \\nsensation when they were totally \\nengaged in an activity they enjoyed \\nand could do well. They all reported \\nachieving a state of mind with no \\nsense of self, in which things came \\nto them automatically—a feeling  \\nof “ﬂow.” It starts, he said, with  \\n“a narrowing of attention on a \\nclearly deﬁned goal. We feel \\ninvolved, concentrated, absorbed. \\nWe know what must be done, and \\nwe get immediate feedback as to \\nhow well we are doing.” A musician \\nknows instantly if the notes he \\nplays sound as they should; a \\ntennis player knows the ball he  \\nhits will reach its destination.\\nState of ecstasy\\nPeople experiencing ﬂow also \\ndescribe feelings of timelessness, \\nclarity, and serenity, which led \\nCsíkszentmihályi to liken it to a \\nstate of ecstasy (in its truest sense, \\nfrom the Greek ekstasis, meaning \\n“being outside oneself”).

Among the many \\ncases in which she was involved, \\nthat of George Franklin perfectly \\nillustrates the different aspects of \\nwhat came to be known as “false \\nmemory syndrome.” Franklin was \\nconvicted in 1990 for the murder  \\nof a child who was best friends \\nwith his daughter, Eileen. Her \\neyewitness testimony, 20 years \\nafter the murder, was crucial to the \\nconviction. Loftus found numerous \\ndiscrepancies in Eileen’s evidence, \\nand proved her memories to be \\nincorrect and unreliable in several \\nrespects, but the jury nonetheless \\nfound Franklin guilty. \\nIn 1995, the conviction was \\noverturned because the court had \\nbeen deprived of “crucial evidence:” \\nthe fact that Eileen had “recovered” \\nthe memory during hypnotherapy. \\nLoftus believed that Eileen’s memory \\nof seeing her father commit the \\nmurder was sincerely believed, but \\nfalse, and had evolved because \\nEileen had witnessed her father \\ncommit other cruel actions, and \\n“one brutal image overlapped \\nanother.” Loftus successfully argued \\nin court that a combination of \\nsuggestion during hypnosis, existing \\nfrightening memories, and Eileen’s \\nrage and grief had created a \\ncompletely false “repressed memory.” \\nThe case of Paul Ingram (which \\nLoftus was not involved in) also \\npointed toward the possibility of \\nimplanting false memories. Arrested \\nin 1988 for sexually abusing his \\ndaughters, Ingram initially denied \\nthe charges, but after several \\nmonths of questioning confessed to \\nthem along with a number of other \\ncases of rape and even murder. A \\npsychologist involved in the case, \\nRichard Ofshe, grew suspicious \\nand suggested to Ingram he was \\nguilty of another sexual offence—\\nbut this time, one that was provably \\nfabricated. Ingram again initially \\ndenied the allegation, but later \\nmade a detailed confession. \\nLost in the mall \\nThe evidence for the implantation of \\nfalse memories was still anecdotal, \\nhowever, and far from conclusive; \\nLoftus suffered harsh criticism for \\nwhat were then considered to be \\ncontroversial opinions. So she \\ndecided to collect irrefutable \\nevidence through an experiment \\nthat aimed to deliberately implant \\nfalse memories. This was her 1995 \\n“Lost in the Mall” experiment. \\nLoftus presented each of the \\nparticipants with four stories from \\ntheir own childhood that had \\napparently been remembered  \\nand supplied by members of the \\nparticipant’s family. In fact, only \\nthree of the four stories were true; \\nthe fourth, about getting lost in a \\nshopping mall, was concocted for \\nthe experiment.

Sometimes \\nwe do not pay enough attention at \\nthe time we do things (such as \\nwhen we put down keys), so the \\ninformation is treated by the brain \\nas trivial and not stored for later \\nuse. In contrast to this is the sin of \\nblocking, where a stored memory \\ncannot be retrieved, often because \\nanother memory is getting in its \\nway. An example of this is the  \\n“tip-of-the-tongue” syndrome, \\nwhere we can nearly—but not \\nquite—grasp a word from memory \\nthat we know very well.\\nSins of commission\\nThe “sins of commission” are \\nslightly more complex, but no less \\ncommon. In misattribution, the \\ninformation is recalled correctly, \\nbut the source of that information  \\nis wrongly recalled. It is similar in \\nits effect to suggestibility, where \\nrecollections are inﬂuenced by the \\nway in which they are recalled, for \\nexample, in response to a leading \\nquestion. The sin of bias also \\ninvolves the distortion of recollection: \\nthis is when a person’s opinions \\nand feelings at the time of recalling \\nan event color its remembrance.\\nFinally, the sin of persistence is \\nan example of the memory working \\ntoo well. This is when disturbing or \\nupsetting information that has \\nbeen stored in memory becomes \\nintrusively and persistently recalled, \\nfrom minor embarrassments to \\nextremely distressing memories. \\nHowever, the sins aren’t ﬂaws, \\nSchacter insists, but the costs we \\npay for a complex system that works \\nexceptionally well most of the time. \\n■\\nDaniel Schacter was born in \\nNew York in 1952.

The hindering forces, or \\nbarriers, to change centered around \\nthe women’s view that the meat \\nwas inappropriate for them and \\ntheir families, and to a lesser degree, \\nthat it would not taste good. \\nLewin set up a study using two \\ngroups of housewives to explore the \\nbest ways of initiating change.

This implies \\nthat the true self is not a private or \\ninternal phenomenon, but rather  \\nthe dramatic effect of the ways in \\nwhich a person presents himself \\npublicly. “Life is a dramatically \\nenacted thing,” Goffman says: \\ncreating a successful impression \\nrequires the right setting, props, \\nwardrobe, skills, and a shared \\nunderstanding of what constitutes \\nbeing on stage (in the public \\nsphere) versus backstage (in the \\npersonal, private sphere). \\nPerformance skills\\nGoffman believes that in real life, \\neveryone has the ability to choose \\ntheir own stage, props, and \\ncostumes to display to the \\naudience.

To put it \\nsimply, “the more you see it, the \\nmore you like it.” \\nResearchers into the mere \\nexposure phenomenon since Zajonc’s \\nexperiment have found that it is \\neven possible to re-create this effect \\nusing sound rather than images. In \\n1974, the social psychologist D.W. \\nRajecki used fertile chicken eggs  \\nas test subjects, playing tones of \\ndifferent frequencies to different \\ngroups of eggs before they hatched, \\nand then playing these tones to \\nboth groups of chicks again after \\nhatching. Without exception, the \\nchicks preferred the tones that \\nhad \\nbeen played to them prenatally. \\nPreferences are not rational \\nZajonc’s ﬁndings indicate that this \\npreference for familiar things is \\nbased purely on the history of \\nexposure to it, and is not affected \\nby a person’s expressed personal \\nbeliefs or attitudes. This holds true \\neven when exposures take place \\nonly on the subliminal level, when \\nsubjects are completely unaware \\nthat they are being presented with \\na stimulus. This discovery led to \\nZajonc’s claim that “preferences \\nneed no inferences,” meaning that \\nZajonc’s 1968 experiment    \\ntested the mere exposure \\neffect by showing people \\nslides of symbols with \\nuneven rates of repetition; \\nthe more frequently someone \\nsaw a symbol, the more \\nthey claimed to like it.   \\naffectionate feeling is not based  \\non reasoned judgement.

The primacy \\nof affect over cognition is also \\napparent in memory, he says, as \\nFrederick Bartlett noted in his book, \\nRemembering: “When a subject is \\nbeing asked to remember, very \\noften the ﬁrst thing that emerges is \\nsomething of the nature of attitude.” \\n Interpersonal attraction\\nThe impact of the mere exposure \\neffect extends beyond the conﬁnes \\nof the laboratory, and out into the \\narea of interpersonal attraction.

Frequent \\ninteractions between people may \\nnot only increase the level of \\nfamiliarity, but also provide an \\nincreasing impression of similarity, \\nthereby breeding positive feelings \\nand ultimately attraction.\\nExposure and advertising\\nAdvertising is another arena in \\nwhich the mere exposure effect \\nplays a crucial role, although the \\npicture here is less clear. Research \\nseems to suggest that repeated \\nexposure to a brand or corporate \\nname would boost sales, but this \\nassumption is evidently overly \\nsimplistic, as it doesn’t take into \\naccount other possible effects of \\nfrequent exposure. \\nOne study used banner ads to \\ntest the mere exposure effect on \\ncollege-aged students. Subjects were \\npresented with an article to read on  \\na computer screen while banner ads \\nﬂashed along the top of the screen. \\nThe results indicated that those who \\nhad been exposed more frequently to \\nthe banner ads did indeed rate the \\nads more favorably than those who \\nhad seen it less frequently or not at \\nall. However, another study found \\nthat familiarity with a brand name \\ncan create an ambivalent attitude. \\nThis may be because people have \\nboth good and bad associations \\nwith familiar companies, and all of \\nthese associations are brought to \\nmind with frequent exposure, \\nleading to greater ambivalence. As \\na result, it is unclear whether mere \\nfamiliarity, created through repeated \\nadvertising, is good for sales.\\nFamiliar faces\\nZajonc found that not only does \\nexposure inﬂuence how a person \\nfeels about someone, but it can \\neven change the way a person  \\nlooks over time. With a group of \\ncolleagues, he conducted a study  \\nto ﬁnd out whether the faces of \\nspouses appear more similar after \\n25 years together. They compared \\nphotographs of couples taken \\nduring their ﬁrst year of marriage \\nwith those taken 25 years later,  \\nand found that couples looked more \\nalike after many years of being \\ntogether. After ruling out several \\nother potential explanations, the \\nresearchers decided that empathy \\nwas the most likely cause. Time \\nhad increased the couple’s empathy \\nfor each other, and since human \\nemotion is communicated through \\nfacial expressions, they may have \\nbegun to mimic each others’ \\nexpressions in the process of \\nempathizing, resulting in similar \\nwrinkle patterns over time. \\nKnown for the breadth of his \\nwork on the basic processes of \\nsocial behavior, Zajonc helped  \\nto create the modern ﬁeld of social \\npsychology.

This theory \\nholds that we are all motivated to \\nact in ways that increase pleasure \\nand decrease pain—we want to \\nthink and behave in ways that will \\nmake us feel better. All pleasure \\nand pain, he says, derives from our \\nefforts to satisfy ﬁve genetically \\nencoded needs: survival, love and \\nbelonging, power, freedom, and fun. \\nAny behavior that satisﬁes one of \\nthese is pleasurable, and any that \\nfails to do so is a source of pain, \\nand ultimately, he explains, it is \\nonly through human relationships \\nthat we can satisfy these needs. \\nWhen we are struggling to survive, \\nthe help of another makes us feel \\ngood; in order to feel love and \\nbelonging, we need at least one \\ngood relationship; to sense even  \\nthe least of our power, we need \\nInterpersonal strife with those close \\nto us leads to rifts and resentments that \\nproduce symptoms of mental illness; \\nthese problems are, in fact, the logical \\nconsequences of troubled relationships.\\nsomeone to listen to what we say; \\nto feel free, we must feel free from \\nthe control of others; and while it is \\npossible to have fun on our own, it \\nis much easier with other people. \\nFor these reasons, he argues, “we \\nare, by nature, social beings.”\\nGlasser emphasizes that lasting \\npsychological problems are usually \\ncaused by problems in our personal \\nrelationships (rather than signifying \\na biochemical abnormality in the \\nbrain), and distress can be \\nremedied through repairing these \\nrelationships without recourse  \\nto psychiatric drugs. He points \\ntoward the basic human need for \\npower, which we try to satisfy by \\nattempting to control other people. \\nIn fact, the only thing that we can \\ncontrol is the way we behave and \\nthink; we cannot control others. \\nTrying to, he says, shows a lack of \\nrespect for others and is the cause \\nof unhappiness. Choice Theory is  \\na self-control psychology designed \\nto counteract this tendency and  \\nto help us ﬁnd happiness within  \\nour relationships. \\n■\\nWilliam Glasser\\nWilliam Glasser was born  \\nin Cleveland, Ohio, in  \\n1925.

As \\nMilgram says, “obedience is as \\nbasic an element in the structure  \\nof social life as one can point to…  \\nit serves numerous productive \\nfunctions.” But equally, the \\ninhumane policies of the death \\ncamps in World War II “could only \\nbe carried out on a massive scale  \\nif a very large number of persons \\nobeyed orders.” His experiments \\nclearly demonstrated that normally \\nharmless people become capable  \\nof committing cruel acts when a \\nsituation pressures them to do so. \\nIn describing his results, \\nMilgram also turned to the theory of \\nconformism, which states that when \\na person has neither the ability nor \\nexpertise to make a decision, he will \\nlook to the group to decide how to \\nbehave. Conformity can limit and \\ndistort an individual’s response to  \\na situation, and seems to result in a \\ndiffusion of responsibility—which \\nMilgram felt was crucial to \\ncomprehending the atrocities \\ncarried out by the Nazis. However, \\nthe conﬂict between a person’s  \\nconscience and external authority \\nexerts a huge internal pressure, and \\nMilgram felt that this accounted for \\nthe extreme distress experienced \\nby the participants in his study. \\nEthical concerns\\nThere were many ethical concerns \\nassociated with Milgram’s study. \\nWhen it was ﬁrst published, the \\nensuing controversy was so great \\nthat the American Psychological \\nAssociation revoked his membership \\nfor a full year. However, it was \\neventually reinstated, and Milgram’s \\n1974 book Obedience to Authority \\nreceived the annual Social \\nPsychology Award.\\nThe major concern was that  \\nthe participants in the experiment \\nwere explicitly deceived, both about \\nthe nature of the study and about \\nthe reality of the electric shocks. \\nMilgram’s defense was that he \\ncould not have obtained realistic \\nresults without employing deception, \\nand all of the participants were \\ndebriefed after the experiment. \\nSelf-knowledge, he argued, is a \\nvaluable asset, despite the \\ndiscomfort that the participants \\nmay have felt when forced to \\nconfront the fact that they behaved \\nin a previously unthinkable way. \\nHowever, many psychologists \\nremained uneasy, and the study \\nwas ultimately crucial in the \\ndevelopment of ethical standards of \\npsychological experimentation. It \\nhelped to deﬁne important principles \\nsuch as the avoidance of intentional \\ndeceit of participants, and the need \\nto protect experimental participants \\nfrom emotional suffering.\\nCross-cultural validity\\nAnother criticism of Milgram’s  \\nstudy was that he used an \\nunrepresentative sample: American \\nmen do not necessarily reﬂect the \\ngeneral population. Even so, Milgram \\nwas able to conclude that obedience \\nwas not a particular feature found in \\nthe minds of 20th-century Germans, \\nbut something more universal. A \\nnumber of cross-cultural replications \\nThe behavior of Nazis during \\nWorld War II had been attributed to  \\na prevalence of the “authoritarian \\npersonality” in the population; this was \\nquestioned by Milgram’s experiments.\\nObedience to authority is not a \\nfeature of German culture, but \\na seemingly universal feature \\nof human behavior.\\nStanley Milgram'),\n",

Their \\nexplanations revealed that \\nchildren’s assumptions about how \\nthe world works are very different \\nto those of adults, leading Piaget to \\nbelieve that children not only think \\ndifferently to adults, but also that \\nchildren of different ages have \\ndifferent methods of thinking.\\nThe evolving mind\\nSince the 17th century, the  \\nidea that a child is effectively  \\na miniature adult had held sway. \\nEmpiricist philosophers of the time \\nhad suggested that a child’s brain \\nworks exactly like an adult’s, but has \\nfewer associations. Another group of \\nthinkers, the psychological nativists, \\nclaimed that certain concepts—\\nsuch as the ideas of time, space, \\nand number—are innate, or “hard-\\nwired” into the brain, so babies  \\nare born with an ability to make \\nuse of them. Piaget’s suggestion \\nthat children’s mental processes—\\nfrom infancy to adolescence—are \\nfundamentally different to an adult’s \\nwas a radical and controversial \\ndeparture from this view.  \\nPiaget himself claimed that it  \\nis vitally important to understand \\nthe formation and evolution of \\nintelligence during childhood, \\nbecause this is the only way we  \\ncan reach a full understanding of \\nhuman knowledge. His use of \\npsychotherapeutic interviewing \\ntechniques to ask children to \\nexplain their answers was inspired, \\nand it became an important tool  \\nin all his research. Rather than \\nadhering to a pre-determined and \\nimpersonal list of questions, this \\nﬂexible method allowed the child’s \\nanswers to determine the \\nsubsequent question. By following \\nthe child’s line of thought, Piaget \\nbelieved he could better understand \\nthe processes underlying it. His \\nrejection of a notion of quantitative \\nor measurable intelligence led to \\nsome groundbreaking theories of \\nchildhood cognitive development. \\nDeveloping the intellect\\nPiaget initially believed that social \\nfactors, such as language and \\ncontact with family members and \\npeers, impacted most on children’s \\nintellectual development. However, \\nwhile studying infants, he realized \\nthat for them language is less \\nimportant and their own activity is \\nparamount. In the ﬁrst few days of \\nlife, babies have limited bodily \\nmovements—mainly crying and \\nsucking—though they quickly \\nbegin to add new actions, such as \\nreaching for a toy. So Piaget \\nconcluded that action, rather than \\nsocial interaction, is the source  \\nof thought at this stage. \\nThis discovery formed part of \\nhis theory that every child passes \\nthrough various stages of cognitive \\ndevelopment, and that these stages \\nare different in quality and are \\nhierarchical. A child only moves  \\non to the next stage upon genuine \\ncompletion of the current stage. In \\nstudies and observations, Piaget \\ndetermined that all children pass \\nthrough the stages in the same \\nsequence, without skipping any or \\nregressing to previous ones. This is \\nnot a process that can be rushed, \\nand although children generally \\ntend to go through the same stage \\nat roughly the same age, each \\nindividual child has his or her  \\nown pace of development. \\nThe four stages deﬁned by \\nPiaget represent levels in the \\ndevelopment of intelligence \\n❯❯\\nSee also: Alfred Binet 50–53  ■  Jerome Bruner 164–65  ■  Lev Vygotsky 270  ■       Erik Erikson 272–73  ■  Françoise Dolto 279  \\n■  Lawrence Kohlberg 292–93  ■  Jerome Kagan 339\\nDEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY\\nEducation, for most  \\npeople, means trying to lead \\nthe child to resemble the \\ntypical adult of his society.\\nJean Piaget'),\n",

A schema is a \\nrepresentation in the mind of a set\\n \\nof ideas, perceptions, and actions \\nthat provide a mental structure  \\nto help us organize our past \\nexperiences, and prepare us for \\nfuture experiences. During infancy \\nand early childhood, a schema can \\nbe as simple as “things I can eat.” \\nHowever, as children grow, their \\nschemas become more complex, \\noffering an understanding of what \\nconstitutes “a kitchen,” a “best \\nfriend,” or “democratic \\ngovernment.” Intelligent behavior, \\naccording to Piaget, is comprised of \\na growing collection of schemas.  \\n \\nFour stages of development  \\nPiaget’s ﬁrst stage is called the \\nsensorimotor stage, and this spans \\nthe ﬁrst two years of a child’s life. \\nDuring this period, infants learn \\nabout the world primarily through \\ntheir senses (sensori-) and through \\nphysical action or movement \\n(motor). Children at this stage are \\negocentric, able to see the world \\nonly from their own viewpoint.  \\nAt the beginning of this stage, \\ninfants practice reﬂexes without \\nunderstanding or intention; later \\nthey can extend and coordinate \\nreﬂexes with objects.

Rather than trying to \\nteach a child to think and behave \\nlike an adult, educators were \\nencouraged to view their  \\nwork as an opportunity to engage \\nchildren in novel and individual \\nmodes of thinking.

They no longer \\nneed to refer to concrete objects, \\nand can follow an argument. They \\nstart to think hypothetically, and \\nthis new capacity for imagination, \\nand their ability to discuss abstract \\nideas, reveals that they have now \\nbecome less egocentric. \\nReaching equilibrium\\nIn addition to deﬁning the four \\nstages, Piaget identiﬁed several \\nfundamental facets of the \\ndevelopmental process that were \\nEducators should not insist  \\non a particular way of doing or \\nunderstanding something, Piaget \\n(pictured left) asserted, but nurture \\nchildren’s natural learning processes. \\nIntelligence is what you  \\nuse when you don’t know  \\nwhat to do. \\nJean Piaget'),\n",

The “situation” included \\nperiods when the mother left the \\nbaby alone with the stranger, then \\nreturned to the room. \\nAinsworth found that the  \\nmost important information about \\nmother-child bonding was gleaned \\nnot from the baby’s reaction to the \\nmother leaving the room, but rather \\nfrom the infant’s reaction to her \\nreturn. She suggested that a baby’s \\nreactions upon reunion with his \\nmother indicate three distinct \\npatterns, or types, of attachment.  \\nAttachment types\\nAround 70 percent of the babies in \\nAinsworth’s studies were “securely \\nattached.” These infants used their \\nmothers “as a secure base from \\nwhich to explore.” They were \\ndistressed when she left the room, \\nbut played happily, even in the \\npresence of a stranger, as long as \\nthe mother was on hand if needed. \\nThe babies who appeared to be \\nindifferent to their mothers, and \\nwere hardly affected when she left \\nthe room, Ainsworth classiﬁed as \\n“anxious-avoidant.” They were as \\neasily comforted by the stranger  \\nas by the mother. About 15 percent \\nof the infants fell into this group. \\nA further 15 percent, described \\nas “anxious-resistant,” were wary of \\nthe stranger, even with the mother \\npresent. They became intensely \\ndistressed when the mother left the \\nroom, but were also angry and \\nresistant to contact on her return. \\nMothers in non-Western cultures \\noften keep their infants close to them \\nat all times.

A sensitive \\nmother, she stated, understands  \\nher child’s needs and responds \\nappropriately to them, creating  \\na secure attachment. \\nCriticism\\nCritics of Ainsworth’s work have \\nsuggested that attachment types  \\nare not always permanent, and that \\nbabies do not ﬁt neatly into a single \\ntype. Cultural differences have also \\nbeen noted. A 1990 study in Japan \\nuncovered an unusually high \\npercentage of anxious-resistant \\ninfants, which may have been due \\nto Japanese babies being less used \\nto separation from their mothers \\nthan US infants.

By \\nproving that a child will imitate the \\nbehavior of an adult role model, the \\nexperiment showed the power of \\nexamples of aggression in society. \\nFor the experiment, 36 boys and 36 \\ngirls, all between the ages of three \\nand six, were recruited from a local \\nnursery school.

In the \\nﬁrst of its two stages (the stage of \\nobedience and punishment), we \\ndetermine whether actions are right \\nor wrong by whether or not they \\nlead to a punishment. In the second \\nstage (the stage of individualism \\nand exchange), right and wrong are \\ndetermined by what brings rewards. \\nThe desires and needs of others are \\nimportant, but only in a reciprocal \\nsense—“You scratch my back and \\nI’ll scratch yours.” Morality at this \\nlevel is governed by consequence.\\nThe second level of moral \\nreasoning starts in adolescence, \\nand continues into early adulthood. \\nIt sees us starting to consider the \\nintention behind behavior, rather \\nthan just the consequences. Its ﬁrst \\nstage, often called the “good boy–\\nnice girl” stage, is when we begin \\nclassifying moral behavior as to \\nwhether it will help or please. Being \\nseen as good becomes the goal. In \\nthe second stage (the law and order \\nstage), we start to equate “being \\ngood” with respecting authority \\nand obeying the law, believing that \\nthis protects and sustains society. \\nMahatma Gandhi was among the \\nfew who reach the ﬁnal stages of moral \\ndevelopment described by Kohlberg. \\nThroughout his adult life, he felt a duty \\nto disregard unjust and oppresive laws. \\nThe third level of moral development \\nis when we move beyond simple \\nconformity, but Kohlberg\\n  suggested \\nthat only around 10–15 percent of us \\never reach this level. In its ﬁrst \\nstage (the social contract and \\nindividual rights stage), we still \\nrespect authority, but there is a \\ngrowing recognition that individual \\nrights can supersede laws that are \\ndestructive or restrictive. We come \\nto realize that human life is more \\nsacred than just following rules. \\nThe sixth and ﬁnal stage (the stage  \\nof universal ethical principles) is \\nwhen our own conscience becomes \\nthe ultimate judge, and we commit \\nourselves to equal rights and respect \\nfor all. We may even resort to civil \\ndisobedience in the name of \\nuniversal principles, such as justice.\\nKohlberg’s six-stage theory was \\nconsidered radical, because it stated \\nthat morality is not imposed on \\nchildren (as psychoanalysts said), \\nnor is it about avoiding bad feelings \\n(as the behaviorists had thought). \\nKohlberg believed children developed \\na moral code and awareness of \\nrespect, empathy, and love through \\ninteraction with others. \\n■\\nLawrence Kohlberg \\nThe youngest of four children, \\nLawrence Kohlberg was born  \\nin Bronxville, New York.

The \\nmajority of autistic children are \\nmale, and most remain impaired \\nthroughout adulthood. Various \\nexplanations for autism have been \\noffered. One of the most recent and \\ninﬂuential theories is Simon Baron-\\nCohen’s “theory of mind” hypothesis, \\nwhich, when supported by his \\nobservations about sex differences \\nin the brain, suggests that “autism \\nis an extreme form of the male brain.”\\nBrain types\\nIn 2003, Baron-Cohen developed the \\nempathizing–systematizing theory \\nof “female” and “male” brains, which \\nassigns a particular “brain type” to \\nevery person, regardless of gender, \\ndepending on ability to empathize or \\nsystematize. His research suggests \\nthat the female brain is largely hard-\\nwired for empathy, with females \\nusually showing more sympathy for \\nothers, and greater sensitivity to \\nfacial expressions and non-verbal \\ncommunication. The male brain, by \\ncontrast, appears to be geared toward \\nunderstanding and building systems; \\nit is mostly interested in how things \\nwork, as well as their structure, and \\norganization.

It requires a different kind \\nof thinking, which Guilford calls \\n“divergent,” since it goes in different \\ndirections and produces multiple \\nsolutions to a problem. In contrast, \\ntraditional IQ tests require thinking \\nthat ends up with a single answer: \\n“convergent” thinking. \\nGuilford thought that creativity \\nwas measurable—it is indicated by \\nthe number of directions in which a \\nperson’s thoughts travel. He devised \\na number of tests to quantify \\ndivergent thinking, including his \\n1967 “Alternative Uses Test,” which \\nasks participants to write as many \\nuses as they can think of for: (a) a \\ntoothpick, (b) a brick, and (c) a paper \\nclip. In his “Consequences Test,” \\nsubjects were asked to imagine all \\nthe things that might possibly\\n  \\nhappen if all national and local laws \\nwere suddenly abolished. Guilford \\nscored the answers on levels of four \\nkey components: originality, \\nﬂuency, ﬂexibility, and elaboration. \\nGuilford claims that intelligence \\nis not made up of just one “general \\nfactor,” but of three different groups \\nof activities. “Operations” are the \\nintellectual processes we use; there \\nare six types of these, including \\nmemory, cognition, and evaluation. \\n“Content” is the type of information \\nor data involved—there are ﬁve of \\nthese, including visual and auditory \\ncontent. “Products” are the results of \\napplying operations to content, such \\nas classes or relations, and there \\nare six of these. The many ways in \\nwhich we combine and use these \\ndifferent types means there may be \\nanything up to 180 (6 × 5 × 6) types \\nof intelligence—more than 100 of \\nthese have already been veriﬁed.\\nThe complexity of Guilford’s \\ntheory and problems with testing \\nmean that his tests are used less \\nfrequently than standard IQ tests, \\nbut his work has inﬂuenced research \\ninto intelligence and creativity. \\n■\\nPSYCHOLOGY OF DIFFERENCE\\nThe person who is  \\ncapable of producing  \\na large number of ideas  \\nper unit of time… has a  \\ngreater chance of having \\nsigniﬁcant ideas.\\nJ.P.

On ﬁrst meeting, \\nto make small talk, Allport told \\nFreud of a small boy he had met  \\non the train on the way, who was \\nafraid of getting dirty and refused \\nto sit near anyone dirty, despite  \\nhis mother’s encouragement. \\nPerhaps, Allport suggested, the \\nchild had learned this dirt phobia \\nfrom his mother, a neat and rather \\ndomineering woman. Freud then \\nasked, “And was that little boy \\nyou?” Freud’s reduction of this \\nsmall observation of Allport’s  \\nto some unconscious episode  \\nfrom his own childhood seemed,  \\nto Allport, dismissive of all his  \\ncurrent motivations and intentions. \\nThroughout his work, Allport \\nemphasizes the present over the \\npast, though later in his life he paid \\nmore attention to psychoanalysis  \\nas a supplement to other methods. \\nAllport argued for an approach \\nto the study of human learning  \\nand personality that was reasoned, \\neclectic, and conceptually open-\\nminded. He took some of what he \\nbelieved from prevailing approaches, \\nbut his central belief is that the \\nuniqueness of each individual and \\nhis or her personality is largely—\\nbut not exclusively—forged in \\nhuman relationships. \\nTheory of personality \\nAllport’s idea of personality is a \\ncomplex amalgam of traits, human \\nrelationships, current context,  \\nand motivation. He identiﬁed two \\ndistinctly different approaches  \\nto the study of personality—the \\nnomothetic and idiographic \\nmethods—both of which had been \\ndevised by the German philosophers \\nWilhelm Windelband and Wilhelm \\nDilthey, but had ﬁrst been put into \\npractice by Allport’s university \\ntutor, William Stern. The ﬁrst \\nmethod, the nomothetic, aims to  \\nbe as objective and scientiﬁc as \\npossible, and it is exempliﬁed in \\nthe study of human intelligence. \\nThis involves obtaining test results \\nfrom large populations of people,  \\non personality traits such as \\nextraversion and introversion. \\nResults can be submitted to a \\nsophisticated analysis, resulting  \\nin a number of general conclusions, \\nsuch as the percentages of people \\nwho are extravert or introvert, or \\nvariations linked to age, gender, or \\ngeography. However, this method \\ndoes not aim to comment in any \\nway on traits at the individual level; \\nit focuses on comparative comments \\nand conclusions about a certain trait, \\nrather than any particular person. \\nThis was the method that the \\nbehaviorist B.F. Skinner used for \\nhis observations of rat behavior.\\nThe second method, the \\nidiographic, stands in direct \\nopposition to the nomothetic \\nmethod; it studies one individual  \\nin breadth and depth, taking into \\naccount their biography, their \\npersonality traits, and their \\nrelationships, as well as how  \\nthey are seen and experienced  \\nby others. This method is much \\ncloser to the psychoanalytic \\nmethod with its focus on one \\nperson, one life.\\nAllport said that while the \\nnomothetic method was a way  \\nof describing traits, it had little \\nexplanatory power; whereas the \\nidiographic method, though unable \\nto draw any general conclusions, \\ncould explain one person in \\nilluminating detail. He was to  \\nuse both methods, though his  \\nwork in general is not known for  \\nits focus on empirical research;  \\nhe was more of a theorist, almost  \\na philosopher. Yet his very ﬁrst \\npaper, Personality Traits: Their \\nClassiﬁcation and Measurement, \\ncowritten with his brother Floyd, \\nwas an excellent example of the \\nnomothetic method. One of his  \\nlast major pieces of work, the \\nanalysis of Jenny Masterson,  \\nwas an extraordinarily detailed \\nexample of the idiographic method.\\nThe lexical hypothesis\\nIn his ﬁrst study, Allport and his \\nbrother reported their research  \\non personality traits. They asked \\nthe participants to complete a \\npersonality questionnaire, and  \\nto ask three people who knew  \\nthem well to complete it too;  \\nthis reﬂected the Allport brothers’  \\nview that personality is forged  \\nin relationship to others. They \\nconcluded from their results that \\nthere is a case for identifying traits, \\nand for attempting to measure \\nthem. They also believed they  \\nhad proven the possibility of \\ndeveloping a complete and \\nsensitive instrument for the \\nmeasurement of personality. \\n❯❯  \\nSee also: Galen 18–19  ■  William James 38–45  ■  Sigmund Freud 92–99  ■  Carl Rogers 130–37  ■  Abraham Maslow 138–39  ■  \\nMartin Seligman 200–01  ■  Paul Salkovskis 212–13  ■  Raymond Cattell 314–15  ■  Hans J.

They \\nnarrowed this down to 4,500 \\nadjectives that they considered  \\nto be observable and stable \\npersonality traits.\\nCardinal traits \\nBased on a further analysis of  \\nhis lexical study, Allport deﬁned  \\nthree distinct categories of traits: \\ncardinal, common, and secondary. \\nCardinal traits are those that are \\nfundamental to a person, governing \\ntheir entire approach to life. Not \\neveryone has a cardinal trait, \\naccording to Allport, but when they \\ndo, they may even be famous for \\nthem; in fact some people are so \\nfamous for them that their name \\nbecomes a byword for that trait, \\ngiving us terms such as Byronic, \\nCalvinistic, and Machiavellian.  \\nOn a less iconic scale, a person’s \\ncardinal trait might be something \\nlike “a fear of communism,” where \\nthis is so central and important to \\nsomeone that it guides and uniﬁes \\ntheir life in both conscious and \\nunconscious ways; virtually every \\nact is traceable to its inﬂuence. \\nIn his later years, Allport \\nconsidered a person’s cardinal \\ntraits as contributing to the \\nproprium: the essential drives, core \\nneeds, and desires of a person. This \\nconcept goes beyond the idea of \\ntemperament, and is more akin to a \\nguiding purpose that will always \\npress for expression. As an example \\nof the proprium, Allport gave the \\nNorwegian polar explorer Roald \\nAmundsen, who had one dominant \\npassion from the age of 15: he \\nwanted to be a polar explorer. The \\nobstacles to his ambition seemed \\ninsurmountable, and the temptation \\nto relinquish his dreams was great, \\nbut the “propriate” striving persisted, \\nand though he welcomed each \\nsuccess, it simply raised his level  \\nof aspiration. Having sailed the \\nNorthwest Passage, Amundsen \\nembarked upon the project that led \\nto his success in reaching the South \\nPole. Then, after years of planning \\nand discouragement, he ﬂew over \\nthe North Pole. His commitment \\nnever wavered, and he eventually \\ndied attempting to save the life of a \\nless experienced explorer.\\nLess fundamental traits\\nIn contrast to cardinal traits, \\ncommon traits are general \\ncharacteristics, such as honesty, \\nthat are found in most people. \\nThese are the building blocks that \\nshape our behavior, but they are \\nless fundamental than cardinal \\ntraits. Common traits, Allport said, \\ndevelop largely in response to \\nparental inﬂuences, and are a result \\nof nurture. They are shared among \\nmany people within a culture but in \\nvarying degrees; aggressiveness, \\nfor instance, is a common trait  \\nthat varies by degrees. According \\nIn 1936, Allport and his colleague \\nH.S. Odbert proposed that individual \\ndifferences that are most salient \\nand socially relevant in people’s \\nlives eventually become expressed \\nthrough language; and the more \\nimportant the difference, the more \\nlikely it is to be expressed as a \\nsingle word.

He \\nhad the resilience to overcome his \\ninitial despair, and fetched arms, \\ntools, and other supplies from the \\nship before it sank.

However, a high IQ is \\nnot enough on its own. Another \\nrelevant component of intelligence \\nis the mental search process which \\nwe use to ﬁnd solutions, by \\nbringing together different ideas \\nfrom memory to form new answers \\nto problems. This mental scanning \\nis guided by ideas of relevance: \\nwhat past ideas and experiences  \\ndo I have that are relevant to this \\nproblem?

The \\nability runs along a scale, ranging \\nfrom an expansive, over-inclusive \\nidea of what is relevant (seeing  \\ntoo many things as potential \\npossibilities), to an overly narrow \\none (seeing few possibilities); at the \\ncenter sits a more conventional \\nsense of what might apply to any \\nproblem at hand.\\nOver-inclusive thinking can be \\nmeasured by word-association \\ntests, which analyze two features: \\nthe number of responses to any \\ngiven word, and the originality of \\nresponses. For example, when \\npresented with the word “foot,” \\nthose with a narrow range of \\nresponses are most likely to \\nsaid that, as with the neuroticism \\ndimension, psychoticism ranges \\nalong a scale; his tests looked for \\nthe occurrence of personality traits \\ncommonly found among psychotics. \\nEysenck found that a number of \\npersonality traits relate to each other \\nto produce psychoticism; those who \\nscore highly on this scale are usually \\naggressive, egocentric, impersonal, \\nimpulsive, antisocial, unempathic, \\ncreative, and tough-minded. A high \\nscore on the scale does not mean a \\nperson is psychotic, and it is not \\ninevitable that they will become so; \\nthey simply share characteristics \\nwith psychotic patients.

David C. McClelland, however, \\nsuggested that peoples’ motivations \\nwere the best predictor of success \\nin the workplace. Through extensive \\nresearch, he identiﬁed the three key \\nmotivations that he believed were \\nresponsible for job performance: the \\nneed for power, for achievement, \\nand for afﬁliation. While everyone \\nhas all three motivations, he \\nmaintained that one would be \\ndominant, shaping a person’s \\nperformance in the workplace. \\nThree key needs\\nMcClelland saw the need for power, \\nor to have control over others, as \\nthe most important motivation for  \\na good manager or leader. But this \\nis only true as long as the need for \\npower is on behalf of a company  \\nor an organization. Someone with  \\na strong drive for personal power \\nmay make a poor team player.\\nHigh quality work, McClelland \\nthought, stems from the need for \\nachievement, which is therefore  \\na far more accurate predictor of  \\njob success than intelligence.  \\nThe drive to achieve, he believed,  \\nis what gives people a competitive \\nedge, helping them to stretch for \\nnew goals and improve. \\nLastly, McClelland claimed that \\nthe need for afﬁliation—to have \\ngood relationships with others—\\nhelps people to work well within a \\nteam. He also noted that people with \\na pronounced need for afﬁliation are \\nunlikely to be successful managers.  \\nMcClelland pointed out that \\nmotivation stems from personality \\ntraits that are deeply embedded in \\nthe unconscious. We are not fully \\naware of our own motivations, he \\nstated, so what we may say about \\nour motives in job interviews or \\nself-report questionnaires should \\nnot be taken at face value. He \\nadvocated using the Thematic \\nApperception Test (TAT), which \\npsychologists Henry Murray and \\nChristiana Morgan devised in  \\nthe 1930s as a way of revealing \\naspects of the unconscious. Rarely \\nused in a business setting, the test \\npresents a series of pictures to the \\nsubject, who is then asked to \\ndevelop a story based on them.  \\nThe assumption is that the stories \\nwill be a projection of the subject’s \\nunderlying abilities and motivations. \\nMcClelland went on to devise an \\ninnovative way of analyzing TAT \\nresponses to allow a comparison \\nbetween the suitability of the \\ndifferent people who took the test \\nto speciﬁc work-related roles.\\n  \\nMcClelland’s ideas revolutionized \\nbusiness recruitment, and although  \\nhis intensive methods of assessing \\njob applicants have lost some of \\ntheir popularity, the basic principles \\nendure.

He \\nstudied psychology at Gemeente \\nUniversiteit, Amsterdam, where he \\nwas awarded a PhD in 1956 for  \\nhis thesis Understanding Facial \\nExpressions. He attributes his \\ninitial interest in emotions to \\nbeing in love, as a student, with \\n“a very expressive girl.” \\nFrom 1952 to 1955 Frijda \\nworked as a clinical psychologist at \\nthe Dutch Army Neurosis Centre, \\nbefore returning to research and \\nteaching. For the next 10 years \\nhe was assistant professor at \\nthe University of Amsterdam, \\nthen professor in experimental \\nand theoretical psychology. \\nFrijda has held visiting posts \\nin universities across Europe, \\nincluding Paris, Italy, Germany, \\nand Spain. He lives with his \\nsecond wife in Amsterdam.\\nKey works\\n1986 The Emotions\\n2006 The Laws of Emotion\\n2011 Emotion Regulation and \\nFree Will \\nEmotions, such as fear, Frijda says, \\nare always “about something.” They are \\nspontaneous responses to changing \\ncircumstances, and reveal much about \\nour relationship with our environment.\\nabout it. We are not suddenly \\nhijacked by our feelings as we are  \\nby our emotions.\\nAction and thought\\nFrijda points out that emotions and \\nfeelings are also displayed differently. \\nEmotions prepare us for action; in \\nsituations that induce fear, they are \\nmotivating forces that prepare the \\nbody to ﬂee or stand and ﬁght. Other \\npeople are able to understand, or at \\nleast guess at, our emotions from our \\nbehavior. Feelings, however, may or \\nmay not be consistent with \\nbehavior, because we can choose \\nto behave in a way that hides them. \\nFrijda sees the basic emotions \\nas an opportunity for greater self-\\nawareness. They accompany a \\nbiological arousal that makes us \\nnotice them and become more \\naware of our feelings. This allows us \\nto factor them into choices we make, \\nand with honest reﬂection, to deepen \\nself-awareness. But Frijda conﬁnes \\nbasic emotions to anger, joy, shame, \\nsadness, and fear. Others, such as \\njealousy and guilt, do not have the \\nsame biological imperative. \\nIn deﬁning and describing a very \\nspeciﬁc set of laws by which \\nemotions operate, Frijda shows that \\nthey emerge, wax, and wane in a \\npredictable way. Reason interprets \\nthem like a barometer, to ensure our \\nmental well-being. “Our emotional \\nselves and reasonable selves are not \\ncompartmentalized,“ Frijda says, \\n“on the contrary, they are connected \\nmuch more than they seem”. \\n■\\nNico Frijda’s groundbreaking book, \\nThe Laws of Emotion, explores \\nthe substance and rules of \\nemotions. He sees them as lying  \\nat the crossroads of biological and \\ncognitive processes: some, such  \\nas fear, are biologically inherent  \\nor innate, and these basic emotions \\nare the ones we share with other \\nanimals. Others arise in us in \\nresponse to thoughts, so are clearly \\ncognition-based. They may even—\\nas in the case of indignation or \\nhumiliation—be shaped by culture.\\nFrijda makes clear distinctions \\nbetween emotions and feelings. \\nEmotions are beyond our control; \\nthey spontaneously arise and alert \\nus to their presence by physical \\nsensations, such as a tightening  \\nin the gut when we feel fear. For \\nthis reason he says that “emotion  \\nis an essentially unconscious \\nprocess.” Feelings, on the other \\nhand, are our interpretations of  \\nwhatever emotions we are \\nexperiencing, and have a more \\nconscious element to them. When \\nwe feel something, we are able to \\nhave thoughts and make decisions'),\n",
